<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter I</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the year 23 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> there lived in Rome a youth
named Gannon. He was a comely lad, seventeen
years old, with a bright and happy face
covered with a light down. His profile was
Greek. His head was poised gracefully on his
vigorous young shoulders. His dark eyebrows
were slightly curved, and two bright black eyes
sparkled under them. His black hair was short
and brushed forward. He was neither tall nor
stout. He wore a tunic which came down to
above his knees, leaving bare his well-shaped
neck, arms, and legs. On his small feet were
leather sandals, held on by a string of the same
material, interlaced and tied above his ankles.
His whole air betokened a frank, ingenuous
nature; and a cheery influence seemed to surround
him, invisible yet perceptible to every one
with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a room of the Praetorian
Camp, translating a letter from Greek into Latin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
The task was not a difficult one; for his parents
were Greek, and he had been taught by his father
to speak and write both languages with fluency
and exactness. His duties consisted in copying
despatches, writing and translating letters, and
taking care of some of the private correspondence
of Sejanus, the commander of the Praetorians.
The situation, although a responsible
one for so young a lad, had been easily secured.
Through a friend of his father he had obtained
a position as secretary to Macro, an officer in
the camp. One day, noticing his intelligent and
handsome face, Sejanus took him to his office
and tested his ability. The result was so favorable
that he made Gannon one of his own
secretaries.</p>

<p>Gannon’s father, Alcmaeon, taught Greek in
one of the schools of the city. He earned barely
enough to support his family of three,—wife,
son, and daughter. It was, therefore, with joy
that he welcomed the day when Gannon was able
to earn his own livelihood. He looked upon his
son’s advancement with pride and yet with foreboding.
While in the employ of Macro, Gannon
had always spent his nights at home; now he
was permitted to go home only one night each
week. Under Macro he had done only clerical
work; now his duties were such that he might
learn some important and dangerous secrets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
With Macro he worked alone; now he was
thrown into the company of unprincipled companions.
At first, when Gannon heard the rough
stories that circulated around the camp, he modestly
retired; but now he could hear the coarsest
ones with little show of shame.</p>

<p>The history of Alcmaeon was a sad one. His
father had been wealthy, but had lost his patrimony
when Antony marched through Greece to
fight Octavianus. With what little he had left
he moved with his wife to Brundusium, a great
seaport town in Italy, where Alcmaeon was born.
They lived there until Alcmaeon grew to manhood
and married. After the death of his father
Alcmaeon took his mother and his wife, Hera,
and moved to Rome, where he rented a small
house outside the city, on a little road that
crossed the Appian Way.</p>

<p>As there was more demand for Greek teachers
in Rome than in Brundusium, he soon found employment
in one of the schools. But his life was
again saddened by the death of his mother. Her
delicate constitution could not brave the fever
that hovered over the suburbs of the city. Soon
after this second loss his daughter, Psyche, was
born, and in the following year Gannon. With
their coming a new era began for Alcmaeon.
After his day’s work at school he hastened home
in joyful anticipation of seeing the smiling faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
of his children. How it pleased him to watch his
little ones grow, day by day! With what delight
he taught their baby lips to speak the language
of his fatherland! How he loved to put them to
sleep, while Hera removed the remains of the
evening meal! During this, the children’s hour,
he would tenderly take them into his arms for a
frolic, and gradually quiet them until their eyelids
grew heavy and closed in sleep. Then he
would gently put them to bed, and softly kiss
them good-night.</p>

<p>When the position as secretary to Sejanus was
offered to Gannon, the lad nearly danced with
joy. His young heart beat stronger and faster
as he broke the news to his family. With such
an opportunity he thought he might advance, by
diligent application, until he should occupy a post
of high honor. He thought that the prayers of
his parents, as well as his own, were at last being
answered; that through him the fortunes of his
family were to be restored. He told his parents
that he would take them back to dear old Greece;
that they should live once more in the country
where, as Alcmaeon said, “The music of soul-stirring
phrases and glorious ideas was forged
by great men on the anvils of poetry and philosophy.”
He worked earnestly and diligently, and
progressed steadily, until he was trusted with
communications to carry to the emperor. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
so promptly responded to every summons, and
so cheerfully carried out the orders of Sejanus,
as to win the favor of that sternest of masters.
His proud and graceful bearing and refined manners
greatly aided in his advancement. Chiefly
because of these advantages, he had been chosen to
carry letters from his master to Livilla, the wife
of Drusus and the daughter-in-law of Tiberius.</p>

<p>His situation, however, was not one of unalloyed
happiness. His promotion engendered
little jealousies and quarrels. At first the other
secretaries in the office of Sejanus treated Gannon
contemptuously. They watched his advancement
invidiously, and one of them, named Alvus,
who had previously been employed to carry letters
to Livilla, quarrelled with him. Words led
to blows, and, although Gannon fought bravely,
he was badly beaten. However, the secretaries
understood that they could not intimidate him.
But there was continual friction, until, one day,
Alvus fell ill. With no feeling of resentment
towards Alvus, Gannon performed not only his
own work, but also that of his sick associate.
By this generous act, by other favors, and by
the ingenuous manner in which he taught his
companions to ornament their speech with Greek
words, a fashion of the day, he completely won
their friendship.</p>

<p>When Gannon carried the first letter to Livilla,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
he looked upon that event as the most important
in his life. He impatiently awaited his night of
freedom, so that he could describe to his family
the magnificent palace on the Esquiline Hill.
When the night finally came, he hurried home.
On his arrival the evening meal was ready, and
his family were awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Hail, father, and thee, mother, and thee,
Psyche!” he cried joyfully, as he entered the
house.</p>

<p>“Art thou not late, my son?” asked Hera.</p>

<p>“Ay, mother. We are always busy at the
camp. To-day many letters came from Greece.”</p>

<p>He lovingly kissed his family. His happy talk
and gay spirits affected them as a flood of light
brightens a darkened room.</p>

<p>“Art thou not hungry, my son?” asked
Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“As hungry as a starving Argonaut,” said
Gannon, laughing.</p>

<p>“Come, Hera! Be the Medea to this starving
Jason,” said the father, catching the infection of
his son’s high spirits.</p>

<p>Hera went to the hearth, and distributed
from a boiling pot a thick soup of barley and
vegetables.</p>

<p>“O my mother! My favorite broth!” exclaimed
Gannon. “A kiss for thy kindness and
thy goodness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Hera smiled as she received her son’s token
of gratitude and affection.</p>

<p>“What news hast thou to feed our curiosity
to-night, my son?” asked Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“I have carried letters to Livilla since I last
saw thee.”</p>

<p>“To the wife of Drusus?” he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ay, father,—but wait until the meal is over.
I will then tell thee all. Where is Gyges?” he
asked roguishly, looking at Psyche.</p>

<p>“He has gone to Capua to try some horses,”
Psyche replied.</p>

<p>“Of a truth, Fortune smiles upon him,” said
Gannon.</p>

<p>“Do you speak of his wealth?” asked Psyche,
shyly.</p>

<p>“Thou dost not understand me, O my sister.
I mean that he is fortunate in winning thee.”</p>

<p>“Rather, Fortune is good to me, my brother.
I am to marry a noble man.”</p>

<p>“The gods be thanked for such a union of
true and loving hearts,” said Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“Thy bowl is empty, my son,” interrupted
Hera. “Wilt thou have more broth?”</p>

<p>“If thou canst spare some,” said Gannon.</p>

<p>Hera gladly refilled Gannon’s bowl.</p>

<p>“In the past week thou hast not visited me at
school,” said Alcmaeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Nay, father; but ’twas not because the desire
was lacking. I had not the time.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou been sent again with letters to
the emperor?” inquired the father, with anxious
interest.</p>

<p>“Only once,” replied Gannon; “but I saw not
the emperor. On the way I passed Nero, that
most fortunate of princes. He assumes the
manly habit in a few days.”</p>

<p>“In the games and entertainments which he
gives the people to celebrate that event, Psyche
will dance,” proudly said the mother.</p>

<p>“What character portrayest thou, my sister?”
asked Gannon.</p>

<p>“Niobe,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I like thy Daphne better,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“’Tis more pleasing, but the character of
Niobe requires more art.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but the movements are more graceful in
Daphne. Niobe is too sad.”</p>

<p>“The dance begins in lively fashion,” she
insisted.</p>

<p>“True. But I like Apollo better when he
pursues a lovely maiden than when he shoots
to kill,” said Gannon, still unconvinced.</p>

<p>At this moment Hera, who had left the room,
reappeared, carrying a plateful of cakes.</p>

<p>“What, my mother! My favorite cakes too!”
exclaimed the youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“I kept them hidden so as to surprise thee,”
replied the fond mother.</p>

<p>“Thou couldst not have pleased me better, my
dear mother,” exclaimed Gannon, with evident
appreciation.</p>

<p>After they had eaten the cakes, and the room
was arranged for the night, Alcmaeon threw himself
upon a couch. Gannon seated himself beside
him, so that, upon leaning back, his head touched
his father’s shoulder. Hera and Psyche sat near
them, side by side.</p>

<p>“Now, my son,” gently commanded Alcmaeon,
“describe to us the palace on the Esquiline
Hill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear father, it is like a dream,”
Gannon began, in a voice filled with enthusiasm.
“The meandering walk that leads from the massive
iron gates to the palace is bordered with
short-trimmed boxwood, over which peep dark
crimson anemones, golden daffodils, purple violets,
pale-blue hyacinths, and the starlike blooms
of the white narcissus. Superb pine-trees interweave
their branches across the walk, revealing
the blue sky as through the meshes of a green
net. Roofs of verdure embower pure white
statues of Diana, Daphne, naiads, and dancing
fauns. Fountains play sweet and endless music.
Quiet pools of water, with lilies floating on the
surface, are bordered by majestic firs. Carved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
marble benches are placed in shady nooks and
corners, and rustic summer-houses here and there
invite to rest. The words of Homer seem to
have become living things. O my father, Maecenas,
the rich minister of the Divine Augustus,
well knew how to group the gifts of the gods in
delightful harmony.”</p>

<p>“Maecenas was more Greek than Roman,
my son,” said Alcmaeon. “No Roman, except
the Divine Augustus, understood beauty as he
did.”</p>

<p>“Maecenas built his palace of marble as
temples are built,” continued Gannon. “Graceful
columns with Corinthian capitals support the
roof of the atrium, peristyle, and corridors. Some
of the rooms have walls of polished marble. All
are lavishly decorated with rare paintings, exquisite
carvings, beautiful statues,—all the work of
the deft fingers of our countrymen. It is not
surpassed even by the palace of Tiberius, which
I described to thee last week.”</p>

<p>“As if by magic, my son,” said Alcmaeon,
proudly, “Greek hands have congealed and fixed
forever the ecstasies of the affections. Painting,
sculpture, and architecture, O Gannon, are the
gifts of the Greeks to the world.”</p>

<p>“On the opposite sides of the atrium,” continued
Gannon, “with their faces towards each
other, are two wonderful busts of Plato and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Socrates. So lifelike are they that they seem to
speak.”</p>

<p>“They are well placed, my son. Plato looks
to Socrates for intellectual light; Socrates looks
to Plato to transmit that light to souls that sit
in darkness.”</p>

<p>“Verily, my father, ’tis strange what influence
the Greeks have over the Romans.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Forget not, my son,” said Alcmaeon,
“that beauty, art, and understanding still rule the
world. Rome has conquered Greece by military
force; but Greece has conquered the world by
that higher celestial force, intellect. Greece has
had her day of wealth and power; but her genius,
her art, her architecture, her statues, her poetry,
and her philosophy are living influences, before
whose vitality the Roman legions are impotent.”</p>

<p>“True, my father. Yet before the Roman
legions the world trembles,” said Gannon.</p>

<p>“The world trembles from fear, not from
the thrill of Roman intellectual power,” earnestly
asserted Alcmaeon. “Rome rules the
body; Greece, the mind. Rome creates worldly
dominions; Greece, heavenly kingdoms. Rome
stands for war; Greece stands for peace.”</p>

<p>“The Greeks were brave, O my father. Are
they not still brave?” interjected Gannon.</p>

<p>Without replying directly to the eager question
of his son, Alcmaeon resumed: “Prometheus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
brought fire to mortals and was punished; Greece
brought reasoning and was punished. But Prometheus
is now free; Greece still feeds from her
vitals the hunger of the Roman eagle, greedy for
gold. Where is the Hercules that will set her
free?”</p>

<p>“Is Greek heroism, then, dead?” asked Gannon.
“Will no Leonidas, no Themistocles, no
Alexander, ever arise again?”</p>

<p>“Nations, like homes, buildings, armies, cities,
and individuals, have their genii, my son,” replied
Alcmaeon. “Who, therefore, knows the caprices
of Fate?”</p>

<p>Alcmaeon spoke the last words slowly, with a
slight tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>“But why should my companions in the camp
taunt me by saying that the Greeks are weak,
effeminate, and cowardly?” asked Gannon.</p>

<p>“The Romans are a vulgar, brutal, and licentious
people,” answered Alcmaeon. “Few of
them understand the higher life, according to
our philosophy. We have done nothing to cause
the blush of shame, O my son. The Romans
believe us weak because we have ceased to fight.
Physical strength wanes with age, but the mind
often retains its vigor. The Romans call us
effeminate. Because our stomachs cannot hold
as much wine as theirs do, are we soft? Because
we, in our Pentathlons, run, jump, wrestle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
throw the discus and javelin; and because the
Romans in their games kill one another and
drink one another’s blood, are we effeminate?
Be proud to be called effeminate under such conditions,
O my son!”</p>

<p>Alcmaeon became more earnest as he proceeded.
Gannon turned so as to see his father’s
face. Hera and Psyche leaned forward, with
breathless attention.</p>

<p>“They call us cowards! Those who do so
lie!” he continued. “Nations are not cowards
if they are conquered while fighting to the death.
We are Corinthians, O my children, and on the
awful day when we were defeated by the Romans
under the inhuman Mummius, the hopes of Greece
fell. Our ancestors were sold as slaves. Our city
was razed and burnt. By the gods of Olympus!”
he exclaimed, “we were not cowards, and we <i>are</i>
not cowards!”</p>

<p>This Alcmaeon said with such fervor that
Gannon, filled with emotion, cried out, “O my
father, I thank thee for those words!”</p>

<p>“What else have the Romans done besides
conquer nations?” added Alcmaeon, stirred by
Gannon’s enthusiasm. “The Iliad that appeared
at the dawn of our history is still the dew that
nourishes the very radicles of our souls. Have
the Romans produced a Homer? Art became
plastic in the quick fingers of the Greeks. Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the Romans produced a Praxiteles or a Scopas?
Greek painting deceived human eyes. Have
the Romans produced an Apelles? Where is
the Roman Phidias, the Roman Demosthenes, the
Roman Aeschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides?
Where are the Roman counterparts of the greatest
men who ever reflected on human minds the
light of the other world? Where, O my children,
where is the Roman Socrates, the Roman
Plato and Aristotle?”</p>

<p>“I understand thee now, my father! I understand
thee now!” cried Gannon, carried to a
higher plane of conception by his father’s superb
climax. “I have fought my companions and
have been beaten. Of a truth, words and
thoughts are more powerful than brute force.
My companions may ridicule my lack of physical
strength, but they have become my friends.
They now respect me.”</p>

<p>“Ay. The Romans understand not the finer
and purer instincts, my son,” said Alcmaeon,
flushed with indignation. “They are a coarse,
vulgar, and brutal people; the Greeks are refined,
elegant, and humane.”</p>

<p>With an effort to calm her father’s agitation,
Psyche now interposed in a voice that seemed
to sing rather than to speak: “But, my father,
beauty is understood by both nations. Is it not
so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Ay, my Psyche; but there are two kinds of
beauty,—the pure beauty of the Greeks and the
corrupt beauty of the Romans.”</p>

<p>“Tell us of Livilla’s beauty, my brother,”
begged Psyche, somewhat weary of this discussion,
and with a natural and innocent curiosity
to know more about the daughter-in-law of the
emperor.</p>

<p>“So beautiful, stately, and majestic is she, my
sister, that I feel, when I stand before her, as if
I stood in a temple, beholding a living goddess.”</p>

<p>“Has she not one fault?” asked Hera, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“To Greek eyes,” replied the youth, “her lips
may seem too thick, her eyes too dreamy.”</p>

<p>“Few women possess the exquisite beauty of
our daughter, my son,” said Hera, weaving the
fingers of her daughter’s hand into those of her
own.</p>

<p>“Would that her figure could be reproduced
in marble!” said Gannon, with an admiring
glance at his sister.</p>

<p>“Psyche’s dancing, my son, leaves an impression
that a sculptured form could not produce,”
replied Hera.</p>

<p>“True, O mother,” said Gannon; “but the veil
of age dims loveliness. A statue of Psyche would
preserve her beauty forever.”</p>

<p>“My son, hast thou watched the attentive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
faces of the spectators when Psyche dances?”
asked Alcmaeon. “Hast thou noticed the
mouths firmly compressed or half open, the
foreheads contracted or expanded? Hast thou
noticed the light of joy and the shadow of
sorrow alternate on their faces? Memories of
Psyche’s impersonations may be perishable, but
to me they are preferable to a figure in marble.”</p>

<p>“What thinks Gyges, my sister?” slyly asked
Gannon.</p>

<p>“He wishes only the living me,” laughed
Psyche, modestly blushing.</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Alcmaeon, “no sculptor now
lives who can create life in marble.”</p>

<p>“Are all our sculptors dead too?” asked
Gannon.</p>

<p>“Art died under foreign oppression, my son.
Artists now copy; they do not create,” replied
his father.</p>

<p>But again the conversation reverted to Livilla.
Hera and Psyche were filled with curiosity to
know the smallest details about the first woman
in Rome. The night was far spent when they
had exhausted Gannon’s information. When the
family separated for the night, Alcmaeon, with
his heart full of love, took his handsome boy by
the arms and said, “You are the picture of your
grandfather.” This was the highest encomium
he could bestow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>In the Praetorian Camp Gannon was working
on a translation. He was all attention. His eyes
would dance from the letter to the copy, and then
he would write rapidly until a word puzzled him.
After pausing a few moments, and biting his
stylus or running his fingers through his short
hair, he would once more write rapidly, softly
breathing a happy song as he did so; for no
noise was allowed in the office of Sejanus. The
other secretaries were working near him. From
time to time officers would pass through the
room and hand out reports to be copied. While
Gannon was thus occupied, he heard his name
called in a commanding tone. He quickly answered
the summons, and was bidden to carry a
letter to Livilla.</p>

<p>Carrying messages was the easiest and pleasantest
duty that Gannon had to perform. It was
a rest to his eyes to see the streets filled with
people. Especially did he enjoy a trip to the
Palatine Hill; for at first he passed some of the
palaces of the richest men on the Quirinal Hill,
and caught delightful glimpses of wealth and
power. He would walk through the Forum of
Augustus, with its beautiful temple of Mars Ultor
and its galleries filled with statues of the greatest
Roman generals. He would pass through
the Forum of Caesar, with its temple to Venus
Genetrix, and then through the Forum Magnum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and, finally, up the Clivus Victoriae to the palace
of Tiberius. Of late, carrying a letter to Livilla
had become an embarrassing errand. Several
times lately she had kept him waiting before her
while she wrote her reply, and occasionally she
would pause and look at him with such a fervent
glance that Gannon would modestly lower his
gaze.</p>

<p>Livia—or Livilla, as hereafter she shall be
called, in order to distinguish her from Livia,
the mother of Tiberius—was at this time in the
bloom of her womanhood. She was the daughter
of Drusus and Antonia. Drusus was the
brother of Tiberius; Antonia, the daughter of
Marc Antony and Octavia, the sister of Augustus.
Therefore there flowed in the veins of
Livilla the blood of both the Julian and Claudian
families. She was a sister of Claudius and Germanicus.
She had married Drusus, the son of
Tiberius, and she made the emperor and her husband
happy by giving birth first to a daughter,
Julia, and then to male twins. In these boys
centred the hopes of Tiberius for the continuation
of the Claudian family as rulers of the
empire.</p>

<p>The wife of Drusus was considered the most
beautiful woman in Rome. Her face was purely
Roman. She had large, black, dreamy eyes that
shone through long lashes, a prominent but handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
nose, lips that were red and voluptuous,
and a bold forehead, crowned with black and
lustrous hair.</p>

<p>When Gannon presented the letter from
Sejanus, she was languidly reclining upon a
cushioned couch in a small but beautifully furnished
room. As she lay there, the graceful
lines of her figure were revealed through the
folds of a loose tunica, or dress, held closely to
her figure by bands of light-blue silk. There was
a certain fervor in her languid movement that
made Gannon retreat a few steps; for her fingers
had touched his, and slightly pressed them. Her
whole form seemed to palpitate under the voluptuous
impulse of an evil thought. After she had
read the letter, she looked at Gannon and softly
said: “Why standest thou so far away? What
fearest thou?”</p>

<p>“I fear nothing,” Gannon timidly replied, with
a slight smile; “but I know not the etiquette
required before great people, my lady.”</p>

<p>“For thee there is nothing to learn. Be natural,”
said Livilla. She turned her handsome face
towards Gannon. She smiled, and showed her
pretty teeth as she added, “Come hither.”</p>

<p>Gannon, somewhat embarrassed, bashfully approached.
“Has no one told thee that thou art
handsome?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why should they?” shyly asked Gannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Because ’tis true. Thine eyes and mouth are
too handsome for a lad. They would make the
fairest woman in Rome proud. Hast thou a
brother?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lady. I have only a sister.”</p>

<p>“Thy parents are living?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of thy sister?”</p>

<p>“Psyche—”</p>

<p>“Is she pretty?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful, my lady. She dances at the
theatre.”</p>

<p>“I have seen her,” said Livilla. Seeing that
Gannon was more at ease, she asked him,
“Wouldst thou like to be a lady’s secretary?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Come, leave the service of Sejanus. I will
pay thee more, and thy duties will be lighter.
Come, take care of my correspondence.”</p>

<p>“I know not what to say,” answered Gannon,
looking at her with an expression of surprise and
anxiety. “To me the details of social life are
unknown, and I am dull at learning. I like my
master. The duty at the camp is more suitable
for me than composing a lady’s letters.”</p>

<p>“My offer is always open,” said Livilla, still
gazing intently at the handsome lad with her
wonderful eyes. She noticed that while he
looked at her his face became flushed. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>tossed her head coquettishly, and smiling and
extending her hand, said: “Do not be shy. Come
nearer. Give me your hand.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_020fp.jpg" alt="She exultantly raised him"></div>

<p>Gannon awkwardly approached. He placed
his hand in hers, and feeling a slight pressure,
fell on one knee and kissed her fingers. A fascination
seemed to overcome him, and he slightly
trembled. He raised his eyes, fearing a reproof;
but the evil look which he met in her eyes frightened
him. Her expression was one of triumph.
Several times before she had tried to break
through Gannon’s reserve. Now she thought her
ends were accomplished. She exultantly raised
him, and placing her face near his, murmured
some inarticulate words that Gannon did not
understand. He felt her breath on his cheek,
and his first impulse was to kiss the lips so near
his own. He hesitated, and hesitation brought
with it fear. He drew back quickly and said,
in a voice choked with emotion, “The answer,
I pray thee.”</p>

<p>This simple and innocent request was made in
an excited manner. Gannon’s face wore a frightened
look. Misunderstanding his true feelings,
and thinking that he was diffident on account
of their difference in rank, Livilla tried to calm
him by reassuring words. Again she put out
her hand and drew him near her; but her sensuous
kiss was given on Gannon’s cheek, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
he had turned his head. Angered at his indifference
and at her defeat, she hastily took up a
stylus and wrote a reply.</p>

<p>“Begone!” she ordered, as she handed it to
him.</p>

<p>In embarrassed silence Gannon took the letter,
and bowed himself from the room. He breathed
more freely as he walked down the path that led
to the street. “What did she mean?” he asked
himself. “The daughter of Antonia in love with
a schoolmaster’s son!” Gannon thought he must
have been dreaming. “Surely she was angry
when she handed me the letter,” he continued.
“What wrong have I committed?” He thought
of what had happened, but recalled nothing for
which he could reproach himself. A feeling of
shame possessed him, like that which he felt when
he first heard a coarse story in the camp. His
face grew stern. Looking at the letter which had
been so roughly handed him, he was astonished
to find it unsealed. Never before had Livilla
failed to seal her letters. His first impulse was
to return, but he could not go back just then.
He decided that an unsealed letter must be one
of little importance, and he proceeded towards
the camp.</p>

<p>As he lightly walked along, he began to wonder
what could be the import of the frequent communications
that passed between Livilla and Sejanus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Here was an opportunity to satisfy his curiosity.
The desire to read Livilla’s reply began to possess
him. He checked it by his stern sense of
honor. But the probability that Livilla might
have written about his forwardness in kissing her
hand stimulated his curiosity. He decided to look
inside, even if he did not read the words.</p>

<p>He quickly opened the letter and glanced inside.
As quickly he closed it; but the swiftness
of his motion did not prevent him from reading
the words, “Lygdus is a good man to do the
deed. Come and see me.” New thoughts now
rushed through his mind. At last he had learned
a secret, a thing against which his father had
always warned him. He would have liked to
tear the words from his mind, but they were
as indelibly fixed there as if carved in stone.
Lygdus, the leering eunuch, whom Gannon knew
and despised, was to commit a secret deed,—perhaps
a crime. Gannon trembled. So uncertain
was the condition of his mind that he dared
not return immediately to the camp. He went
instead to the Forum of Augustus. Before the
beautiful statues of the great Roman generals
and heroes in the shadow of the wonderful
temple of Mars, he became calmer.</p>

<p>But questions shrouded in mystery still presented
themselves to him. “Why had Livilla
chosen the wicked Lygdus to do some dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
deed? Were Sejanus and Livilla lovers? Did
their letters contain a plan to rid them of a
hateful rival?” he asked himself. In the camp
he remembered to have heard the soldiers say
that one day Drusus struck Sejanus in the face.
Sejanus, he had been told, had never forgotten
that insult. But after carefully weighing the
perplexing questions, Gannon decided that carrying
letters was his duty, no matter what they
contained. Still he wished he had left Livilla’s
reply unread. When he reached the camp and
handed her letter to Sejanus, he had regained his
usual composure.</p>

<p>“Where is the seal?” immediately demanded
Sejanus.</p>

<p>“It was not sealed, my lord,” Gannon replied,
with nervous haste.</p>

<p>“Hast thou read the letter?” he imperiously
asked.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord.”</p>

<p>“It is of little importance,” said Sejanus,
closely watching Gannon’s face. “Hereafter
every communication carried to or from me
must bear a seal. The failure to observe this
rule will cost more than a dismissal. Go to thy
room. Speak to no one. Wait until I send for
thee.”</p>

<p>Gannon walked slowly from the room. A
sudden impulse came over him to return and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
confess to Sejanus that he had read the letter;
but at that moment he was prevented by the
entrance of another secretary, who handed a
letter to Sejanus. With a heavy heart Gannon
went along the corridor outside of the office, and
slowly mounted the flight of steps that led to his
room. When he arrived there, he threw himself
upon his couch and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Sejanus had spoken harshly to him. “The
order to go to my room was given in anger,”
Gannon said to himself. He now felt sure that
Livilla’s reply was more important than Sejanus
had admitted. “What did he mean when he
said that hereafter the failure to have letters
sealed would mean more than a dismissal?” he
thought. “Could he mean imprisonment, or,
worse, could he mean death?” The thought of
being imprisoned without being able to communicate
with his parents tortured the lad’s very
soul.</p>

<p>This was his first trouble, and in facing it he
realized his own weakness. A window in his
room looked out upon a large courtyard where
the soldiers practised their manoeuvres. Leaving
his couch, he watched them in their various formations.
But the words, “Lygdus is a good man
to do the deed,” were constantly recurring to his
mind. “What would Sejanus do if he thought
I had read Livilla’s reply?” he asked himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
“Would he see that my tongue is forever
hushed?” Gannon shook with fear. He felt
that he must communicate with his family,
but how? He sat down and wrote a letter,
but that he destroyed. “Who would carry it to
them?” he asked himself. His handsome face
had grown haggard with anxiety. His young
heart was burdened with the consciousness of his
deceit. Finally a plan for communicating with
his family occurred to him, like a thought of
hope to a despairing soul. Taking up a scrap
of cloth, he wrote upon it in the smallest possible
Greek characters the following words:
“Have done wrong. Read a letter from L to
S about Lygdus.” This he sewed to the under
side of his tunic. Then, more contented, he
threw himself upon his couch and waited to be
called. He waited many hours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AELIUS SEJANUS, commander of the
Praetorians, was a tall and robust man,
with a fine commanding head, set upon a coarse
thick neck. He had a bold, hard, and evil face,
which could at times appear weak, gentle, and
friendly. His light-gray eyes were commanding
and yet kind; his large mouth was voluptuous,
yet firm. In fact, his nature was so complex and
deceptive that he could instantly change from love
to hate, from proud authority to fawning servility,
from dignified sincerity to unctuous flattery.
He was a man and yet a beast; an honest friend,
a brave soldier, and a detestable villain. He was
a living lie.</p>

<p>Years before, the Divine Augustus had been
satisfied to distribute his guards among the surrounding
towns of Rome; but the cowardly
Tiberius had built a huge camp of bricks and
marble, and in it he placed his soldiers, so that
he could mobilize them more quickly in case of
need. Over the soldiers he stationed his faithful
minister, Sejanus, whom he trusted as he did no
other man. Money had been so lavishly expended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
upon the building that it resembled a
palace more than a guard-house. Its spacious
rooms, polished-marble corridors, grand, imposing
stairways, and courtyards surrounded by
beautiful columns with finely wrought capitals,
were elaborately adorned with carved candelabra,
tables of variegated marbles, statues, and fountains.
At one end of a spacious corridor stood
the statue of Tiberius. At the other end, by the
emperor’s order, one of Sejanus had recently been
erected. A soldier, commenting upon this arrangement,
said, “Sejanus watches the emperor
day and night.”</p>

<p>Though of low origin, Sejanus had succeeded
in attaching himself, some years before, to Caius
Caesar, the grandson of the Divine Augustus.
When Livia, the mother of Tiberius, had accomplished
the death of that heir, Sejanus sold himself
to the greatest epicure and spendthrift of the
time, Apicius. In order that the flame of literature
might not become extinct during the inglorious
reign of Tiberius, Apicius composed a
cook-book! His wealth was enormous; yet, fearing
that he might some day die penniless, he
committed suicide. With money dishonorably
obtained by pandering to the low tastes of Apicius,
Sejanus bought the friendship of the dissolute
men who circled around Tiberius. At this
time the emperor was beginning to cast his evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
shadow over the city. With infernal ingenuity
Sejanus so endeared himself to Tiberius that the
emperor withdrew his favor from the other satellites
and made Sejanus his adviser and minister.</p>

<p>Like a serpent, Sejanus would coil himself
around his victim, and if the victim proved too
strong to crush, he would use his poisoned fangs.
Like a panther, he would crouch in the vilest
holes; and when he saw his prey unguarded,
he would steal upon it with padded feet, spring
upon it, and strike it down. Like a huge tarantula,
he would suck the life-blood of some wealthy
man; but, less merciful than the tarantula, he
allowed his victim to live on and suffer.</p>

<p>At present he was captain of the guards, chief
officer of the most important military body in the
empire. Moreover, he was the associate and particular
friend of the emperor. He was yet more,—the
confidant and principal adviser of the emperor.
In all the emperor’s shameless pleasures,
fiendish intrigues, and atrocious villanies, Sejanus
was an abettor and a panderer. Step by
step he had risen; and although these steps were
stained with vice, robbery, and murder, he had
reached the eminence of being the second man
in Rome. In this rise to power Sejanus had not
abandoned his old associates; but as he mounted
higher, he drew them with him. Neither did he
allow the halo of influence to dazzle and bewilder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
him. On the contrary, like the eagle, the higher
he soared, the better view he took of his surroundings.
He was always easy of access, and
by his servility to the emperor and by his
graciousness to those below him he had gathered
about him a cordon of friends, so that
whenever he walked through the streets he was
greeted with cheers.</p>

<p>Such was his versatile nature that he was
equally at ease in the palaces of the most refined
and in the camp with his soldiers over their cups.
He could talk the airy nothings of social gossip
to the flippant ladies of the city, and then join
the noble matrons and converse on serious subjects.
He was the friend of virtuous senators
and of vicious profligates, of pure aristocrats
and learned philosophers, of foul vermin of the
under strata and of vulgar voluptuaries. Cruelty
was another trait of his character. When he beat
his little son so hard that he broke a limb, he
watched the sufferings of the child without raising
a helping hand. He could look at one of
his slaves—punished for some trivial offence—writhing
under the lash, and smile even when the
welts were sweating blood. Without a gleam of
pity he would torture a man to swear to a lie
until the flame of his victim’s life was nearly
extinct. As he found that his wife and children
weighed heavily upon him and prevented him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
from progressing, he abandoned them. With all
his servility, graciousness, and dissimulation, there
was only one idea that ruled him,—ambition.</p>

<p>He had made Livilla, the wife of Drusus, believe
that he loved her, and had even penetrated
to her chamber and so compromised her that an
exposure of her indiscretion would have meant
death or exile to them both. The letter that
Gannon had carried from Livilla contained her
acquiescence to a foul and terrible deed. Sejanus
believed that Gannon had not read the letter; but
doubt on a question so important made him ill at
ease. After having sent Gannon to his room, he
went to see Livilla.</p>

<p>Livilla and her little twin sons were playing
with some gold-fish in a fountain when Sejanus
was announced. She left the little boys in charge
of their nurse and retired to her room.</p>

<p>Sejanus greeted her like an ardent lover;
she received him with a nervous reserve. She
trembled slightly when he asked, “Where is
Drusus?”</p>

<p>“He has gone to Bovilla.”</p>

<p>“When will he return?”</p>

<p>“At sundown.”</p>

<p>“Shall we, then, be alone until sundown, O
my Livilla?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Sejanus. But I wish to talk with
thee concerning Lygdus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“The eunuch will be here to-morrow morning,”
replied Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Art thou sure of him?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“He is like the second half of my heart, my
Livilla.”</p>

<p>“But is he trustworthy and silent?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“In important transactions his lips are as
silent as those of the dead.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes fear—” she began.</p>

<p>“What!” he interrupted. “Art thou beginning
to fear at this time?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Hearken unto me, O daughter of Antonia.
The plans that Sejanus makes never miscarry.”</p>

<p>“But I hesitate at this last step,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Ah, Livilla,” said Sejanus, fervently, “thou
rulest my life, my heart, my very soul, but I
cannot now defer action. A plan may be well
formed, but hesitation brings disaster.”</p>

<p>“But is there no other way?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“There is no other way,” he replied impressively.
“But why fearest thou? Be strong. Be
brave. Trust in me. Tullia took this course to
find happiness with Tarquinius. Clytemnestra
gave up Agamemnon for Aegisthus. Art thou
weaker than they were? In thy veins flows the
blood of the mighty Marc Antony. Did thy noble
ancestor tremble at the death of his enemies?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Tullia and Clytemnestra were dissolute. Thou
art an outraged woman.”</p>

<p>“Not so loud, O my love,” she whispered
cautiously. “We may be overheard.”</p>

<p>“Where is thy servant Marcia?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She is within calling distance. Have a care,”
she warned him.</p>

<p>He softened his tone as he poured out his passion.
“I can no longer live apart from thee, O
my love,” he exclaimed. “I love thee! oh, how
I love thee! The gods alone understand a love
that cannot be told. If all the openings in this
room were ears, if all the sparkling objects were
eyes, they would hear and see that I love thee.
A dangerous love, sayest thou? Ay; but if death
be the ultimate reward, I will be content if I
have obtained thy love.”</p>

<p>As a sleeping child is wooed by the whisper
of a mother’s voice, so Livilla succumbed to the
loving words of Sejanus. They affected her like
a narcotic. Her objections gave way, her nervousness
disappeared, and her fear completely
vanished. Her face, which at first was overspread
with an unnatural pallor, gradually became
flushed. Her eyes lost their frightened
stare, and grew soft and dreamy. Her quivering
mouth became firm and composed. Observing
the change that was passing over her, Sejanus
approached and took her in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“I love thee, O Sejanus!” exclaimed Livilla,
abandoning herself to his caresses. Suddenly,
as if struck by a happy inspiration, she asked,
“Could we not leave Rome and live together in
a foreign country?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but what corner of the empire could long
hide the daughter of Antonia and the minister of
Tiberius?” he asked.</p>

<p>“But, O my love, I cannot here in Rome become
thy wife,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Thy love is impotent if so thy feelings are
ruled. That is not like the love I bear thee. O
my Livilla, I have sacrificed wife, children, friends,
for thee. Ay, for thee I would even sacrifice my
power. What more can a man do?”</p>

<p>His passionate words overcame her fear. She
yielded and said, “I consent.” Then she whispered:
“Send Lygdus to me. Complete thy plans.
I will share everything with thee, bear everything
with thee.”</p>

<p>“Of a truth, thou canst not desire to live
longer with the man who abuses thee worse than
his slaves,” said Sejanus. “Gamblers, drunkards,
unscrupulous and dissolute men and women, are
his friends. He loves the mute statues on these
walls more than he loves thee. He would not
sacrifice a cup of wine to make thee happy.”</p>

<p>Sejanus again placed his arms around her, and
with his lips near hers he continued: “I love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
thee, O my Livilla, with all the strength of my
nature. In the very marrow of my bones I long
for thee always. True love is no crime. The
gods have so loved. Forsake Drusus, who insults
thee. Come to the arms of one who adores
thee.”</p>

<p>“May the gods forgive me if it be a sin; but
I love thee, O my Sejanus, I love thee!”</p>

<p>As Livilla spoke these words, he covered her
mouth with kisses. He led her to a couch, and
seating himself beside her, said: “I have never
seen thee more beautiful than thou art now. This
struggle has made thy lovely face more radiant
than that of Eos. Be not gloomy! A bird sings
louder and more joyously when freed from its
cage. Love’s flame burns brighter when fed by
pure oil. Thy beautiful hands will never be
stained with my crimes. Let me kiss thy fingers!
Let me kiss thy mouth! Let me love thee
now.”</p>

<p>The splash of the water in the fountain, the
happy voices of the little twins at play, a joyful
song from the lips of Julia, Livilla’s daughter,
were the only sounds that entered through the
curtained door while the wicked lovers sat locked
in each other’s arms. Livilla started when she
thought of the time, and said, “The day is fleeting,
O my love; thou must now depart.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, before I go,” asked Sejanus, loosening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his embrace, “was the letter sealed which
thou didst send me this morning?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Sejanus. Never do I send a letter
without a seal.”</p>

<p>“Gannon gave it me unsealed.”</p>

<p>“I like not thy Gannon,” she said, frowning.
“He is impertinent. He angered me this morning.
I wrote the letter hastily, but I am sure I
did not forget the seal.”</p>

<p>“Have I been so mistaken in the boy?” questioned
Sejanus. “He told me he did not read
the reply.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou such faith in him?” she asked.
Then in a warning tone she said: “Beware, O
Sejanus! Trust him not. But go! Send Lygdus
to-morrow morning! Come to me after the dinner
to-morrow night!”</p>

<p>The shameless lovers then embraced and
separated.</p>

<p>Sejanus, with his few followers, had hardly
left the entrance to the palace, when Drusus,
highly indignant, arrived there with a crowd
of clients, freedmen, and slaves. The cause of
his indignation was that the guards had refused
to obey an order which he had given them, basing
their refusal upon the ground of a contrary
order from Sejanus. This exhibition of effrontery
was very humiliating to Drusus, especially
since it had taken place before his followers. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
such clashing of authority had become of frequent
occurrence of late. These daily conflicts
kept the jealous Drusus continually in a state of
ill-humor. He dismissed his friends and walked
up the path that led to the palace, cursing the
author of his troubles.</p>

<p>Drusus had inherited the vices of his father,
Tiberius, and none of the virtues of his mother,
Vipsania. He had a bloated, sullen face, with
a large Roman nose and bloodshot eyes, overshadowed
by a brow that always frowned. His
mouth was large, with thick, voluptuous lips. He
looked upon life gloomily, and seldom found anything
worth a smile. His drinking was excessive,
his behavior dissolute. His impressionable
nature bore the imprints of his wicked associates,
who, believing that he was to be their next emperor,
pandered to all his vicious passions.</p>

<p>But he had not always been sullen and profligate.
His star of good fortune once shone
brightly. He had successfully waged war against
the Illyrians and Pannonians. However, on his
return to Rome after his brilliant campaigns,
although he was the son of an emperor, he had
little authority. The empty, high-sounding titles
bestowed upon him by his father humiliated more
than they elated him. He was disappointed, enraged,
to see favors, wealth, and honors showered
upon Sejanus and his friends, while he, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
emperor’s son, and his retainers, received no substantial
recognition. The insults he daily experienced,
the opposition, and the ridicule,—all
these things had so embittered his nature that
he had become indifferent to everything except
the gratification of his desires and pleasures.</p>

<p>The visits of Sejanus, and the knowledge that
letters passed between his wife and Sejanus,
excited him to violent anger. He doubted
Livilla’s fidelity, but sufficient proofs of her
wrongdoing were lacking. Being informed by
a servant that Sejanus had just left the palace,
he broke into a towering passion and sent for
Livilla.</p>

<p>“Sejanus has been here again!” he bellowed,
when she appeared.</p>

<p>“He has, my lord,” she replied. “On his way
to the Palatine Hill he called to pay his respects.”</p>

<p>“His respects,” sneered Drusus. “Let him be
more respectful to his family; ay, more respectful
to me!”</p>

<p>“He came to say that he would not be at
dinner to-morrow night,” she ventured, with
forced composure.</p>

<p>“Thou liest, O wicked woman!” he shrieked.
“’Tis not true! He came to insult me, to tell
thee that I am a brute, to try to turn thee
against me!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord; he—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Have done with thy deceit!” he interrupted.
“Has he written thee also to-day?”</p>

<p>“He has, my lord,” she fearlessly replied.</p>

<p>“What mean these meetings, O deceitful
woman? What is in these letters he sends
thee? Where didst thou see him?”</p>

<p>“In my room—”</p>

<p>“Alone?” he bawled. “In thy room with
that villain! Thou hast the insolence to tell <i>me</i>
that?”</p>

<p>“We were not alone. My servants were with
me.”</p>

<p>“Thou liest!” he shrieked. “There is no truth
in thee. Thy face is fair, thy heart evil!” cried
the infuriated man, pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for some time. Suddenly Drusus
stopped walking, and roared a command that the
servant Marcia should be brought before him.
When the trembling maid appeared, he asked her,
“Where wert thou when Sejanus was here?”</p>

<p>The poor woman knew not how to reply. She
looked beseechingly at Livilla.</p>

<p>“Strip her and lash her until her tongue is
loosened,” ordered Drusus, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>At the sight of her favorite maid being
brutally handled by the servants of Drusus,
Livilla became infuriated. Rushing between
them, her eyes flashing fire, she cried: “Canst
thou not believe a truthful wife, O son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Tiberius, without questioning her servants? I
have told thee that Sejanus came here to say
that he would not be at the dinner to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p>Taking this cue from her mistress, the woman
now easily answered the questions of Drusus.</p>

<p>When the ordeal was over and Drusus and
Livilla were left alone, he said: “Marcia must
be dismissed. One of <i>my</i> selection will take her
place. And now, O Livilla, never again must that
man see thee in thy room. I hate him. No
hatred can be more intense. He hates me too.
He would have preferred to see my father without
an heir, for then there would have been one
obstacle less between him and his coveted goal.
He is a thorn in my side. So continually does he
torment me that my only solace is in the cup.”</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and a servant appeared.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt remain with me, O Livilla,” he
commanded.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord. I wish to be alone,” she replied,
as she proudly walked from the room.</p>

<p>“I will not be alone!” he cried to his servant.
“Go! Seek some friends! Tell them
that Drusus will drink to-night. Tell them that
Bacchus will rule on the Esquiline. Go, boy!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On a sumptuous couch in a gorgeously furnished
apartment of the Praetorian Camp Sejanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
proudly reclines. It is midnight. The room is
lighted by a bronze lamp, shaped like a satyr’s
face. It rests on a slender bronze pedestal with
a base of three cloven feet. Carved figures of
fauns, sylphs, and nereids in graceful poses
come out of the shadows like dancing sprites.
Red and yellow oriental silks, carelessly thrown
over the chairs, look in the sallow light like
tongues of flame. In a bronze tripod, ornamented
with naked sylphs and satyrs, burns perfumed
charcoal. An odor of incense pervades
the room. The light seems to be a reflection
from the lower world. Everything suggests an
incantation.</p>

<p>Sejanus is happy. His face, in the yellow light,
looks like that of a leering demon. As he reclines
there, he is building huge and lofty castles
in the air. He looks into the future. He sees
a man seated on a curule chair, imperiously making
laws and rendering decisions. That man is
Sejanus. Again he sees a man clad in triumphal
robes of purple adorned with gold. He is standing
in a chariot of silver, drawn by four white
horses abreast. In his right hand he carries a
laurel branch; in his left, an ivory sceptre. Behind
him a slave holds a golden crown over
his head. The Forum is thronged with people,
dressed in soft white togas and crowned with
shining leaves or bright flowers. Songs of boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and girls, chants of priests and priestesses, war
songs of the legions, joyful notes poured from
long golden trumpets, and acclamations of the
people, all rend the air. The glad tumult echoes
from pillar to pillar of the pure white temples garlanded
with flowers, as the Victor rides along the
Via Sacra towards the Capitoline Hill. That
Victor is Sejanus. Again he sees, seated on a
throne, a man before whom senators, ambassadors,
and kings of nations prostrate themselves,
all anxiously, breathlessly, waiting to hear the
words that fall from his lips. That emperor is
Sejanus. Once more he looks into the future,
and he sees a statue of a man placed amongst
those of the gods. He sees the people falling
down and worshipping it, as they do those of the
Divine Julius and the Divine Augustus. He sees
a body of priests and priestesses chanting litanies
and making sacrifices to this new god. That new
god is SEJANUS.</p>

<p>However, these dreams of self-advancement
and self-glorification are far from being assured
facts; for between him and the consummation of
his dreams are many obstacles. There is Drusus,
the son of Tiberius; there are the twins, sons
of Drusus and Livilla; there are the sons of
Germanicus,—Drusus, Nero, and Caligula,—these
last being real princes of the blood of the
Divine Augustus; there is the emperor himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>But to this man, who can compass seeming
impossibilities, nothing is too difficult. With
such immense odds against him, he does not
falter. Murder, the infamous tool that Livia
and Tiberius had wielded to cement their power,
is understood equally well by him. The five
atrocious murders in the family of the Divine
Augustus had sown in the heart of Sejanus seeds
that have matured into deadly fruit.</p>

<p>He had recently executed a murder for the
emperor in a peculiarly skilful and satisfactory
manner. In gratitude for this service the emperor
decreed that wherever one of his own
statues stood, a statue of Sejanus should be
erected beside that of his royal master. With
this supreme honor conferred upon him, with the
flattery of senate, soldiers, and common people,
and with the conquest of Livilla’s heart, and her
consent to his ambitious and murderous schemes,
he feels well content with himself as he lies there.
He is an emperor in everything except the name.
But one thing must be done before he can feel
absolutely secure. He calls a soldier, and gives
an order, after which he takes up a silver cup
and with an evil smile slowly sips his wine.</p>

<p>While Sejanus lies there dreaming, Gannon is
pondering over his troubles. The poor lad patiently
awaits some sign that can be construed
as a hope of pardon. He has seen no one except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
a servant, who carried him some supper. The
time passes slowly, and the monotony of silence
is broken only by the soldiers as they call out the
hours for changing the watch. He is sleepy, and
decides to go to bed. Just then he is startled by
hearing footsteps in the corridor. He hears his
name called, and receives an order to appear on
the roof. Joyfully he springs from his couch,
for he thinks he is now pardoned. Yet the command
is an unusual one. What can it mean?
With his young heart bounding with hope, he
mounts the steps lightly, taking care not to
stumble in the darkness. When he reaches the
last step, the soldier, who had shortly before received
an order from Sejanus, catches him by
the throat, another seizes his body, and before
the poor boy can collect his thoughts, he is carried
to the railing that borders the edge of the
roof, and is thrown into the street below.</p>

<p>As he strikes the ground, a pitiful groan is
heard. A spasmodic tremor passes through his
body, and then all is still.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Gannon was anxiously considering
how he could communicate with his
family, they were safe and happy at home. The
evening meal was finished, and they were seated
in the atrium of their one-storied house of four
rooms. On a wooden table burned a small
terra-cotta lamp, which shed a dim light through
the room. Psyche and her mother were seated
together. Alcmaeon lay on a couch near
them.</p>

<p>“Hast thou finished rehearsing for the celebration,
O daughter?” asked Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“On the afternoon of the morrow the last
rehearsal will take place, O my father,” she
replied.</p>

<p>Psyche was a charming maiden, eighteen years
old. She had an exquisite face, with large soulful
eyes, like a young doe’s, a mouth like that of
a sculptured Aphrodite, and pretty nose, cheeks
and forehead like those of the beautiful daughter
of Zeus and Leda. All her features blended so
harmoniously with the refined sinuous lines and
curves of her body that she formed a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
figure of beauty. Like the beloved of Eros,
whose name she bore, she would have been persecuted
by the jealous Venus if she had not had,
like that other Psyche, a devoted protector.</p>

<p>When a little girl, she had taken part in religious
processions. As she grew older and her
beauty developed, she led these processions. Instinctively,
while taking part in them, she learned
so easily to portray the pure emotions by her
pose, gait, and dance, that she had been drawn
gradually into theatrical spectacles. At first
Alcmaeon objected to Psyche’s dancing in public;
but her graceful movements so pleased him, and
her success in pleasing others was so pronounced,
that he finally consented.</p>

<p>It was marvellous what force she could put
into her movements. By her grace of action
alone, she could represent the tragic Iocasta, the
majestic Clytemnestra, and the pleading Penelope.
Whether she were delineating the happy
Aspasia, the outraged Lucretia, or the proud
Cornelia, she budded and bloomed in the attentive
air of her audience like a soft flower of
feminine grace. She could so adjust her costume
that she appeared like a butterfly floating
about the stage, trembling in her pauses as if
she were hovering over a flower. Her greatest
characterizations were those of the inquisitive
and mournful Psyche, the nimble and fleeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Daphne, and the tearful and grief-stricken Niobe.
In these representations she was an embodied
thought of a Phidias or Praxiteles.</p>

<p>At the games to be given by Nero, Agrippina’s
son, on his arrival at the manly age, she was
to portray the character of Niobe at Pompey’s
Theatre.</p>

<p>“Art thou not sorry that this dance will be
thy last, my daughter?” asked Hera.</p>

<p>“Ay, my mother.”</p>

<p>“The wife of Gyges must lead a more serious
life than that of a dancing-girl,” said Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“Dost thou yet know where thy new home is
to be?” asked Hera.</p>

<p>“Nay, my mother. Gyges wishes to surprise
me.”</p>

<p>“Wherever it be, O daughter, thy home will
be a pleasant one,” said Alcmaeon. “Gyges is
a good and noble son of Greece. He inherits
his father’s mild temper and goodness. He is
wealthy. Thy new home will contain more luxuries
than thy old one. But hearts cannot beat
with love for thee more than ours do, my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“As the wife of Gyges, I am no less the
daughter of Alcmaeon. When I wed, thou losest
not a daughter, thou gainest another son,” said
Psyche, sweetly.</p>

<p>“Oh that Gannon were here to-night!” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Hera. “Does not thy heart yearn for our son,
my Alcmaeon?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Hera. ’Twas I who allowed him
to go to the camp. Would that I had found him
another position!”</p>

<p>“But he is paid well for his services,” said
the mother.</p>

<p>“I would rather that he received less and were
home more. I like not Sejanus,” said Alcmaeon,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Hast thou seen Gannon to-day, my father?”
asked Psyche.</p>

<p>“I saw him only yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Said he naught of us?” questioned the
mother.</p>

<p>“Ay, O Hera. He asked for thee, and thee,
too, Psyche. He said only a few words; but
they were happy ones. After he had gone, they
seemed to me to have come from the smiling lips
of his soul. Ah! if it would not break his heart,
I would take him away from the camp.”</p>

<p>“When he next comes home, let us ask him
to leave the camp,” said Hera.</p>

<p>“Dost thou remember, O my Hera, the night
he told us of his promotion? Then he spoke
with difficulty; joy choked his words. His handsome
young face was as radiant as that of Apollo,
who drives the sun on its daily course. To have
stemmed the flood of his enthusiasm at that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
would have been an outrage. In his roseate view
of the future he had us all transported back to
the country of our fathers,—back to Corinth,
to the city that was the glory of the Hellenes.”</p>

<p>“Verily he shall accomplish his purpose!”
exclaimed Psyche, her face flushing with the
reflection of her father’s deep emotion.</p>

<p>“Ay, few boys are as buoyant and hopeful as
Gannon,” replied Alcmaeon. “He is a thorough
Greek. He knows well the history, the language,
and the religion of our beloved country. He is
a true son of the Iliad.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Alcmaeon, a true son of the Iliad,
and a true son of our ancestors,” added Hera.</p>

<p>“With joy I shall welcome the day when I
go to Corinth,” said Psyche, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“When shalt thou go?” asked Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“I know not; but I have the promise of Gyges
to go there with me some day. Thou knowest
that his ancestors were also of Corinth.”</p>

<p>“Before I married thy mother, O Psyche,”
said Alcmaeon, “my father took me to Corinth.
A desire had always burned in me to see that glorious
city. A relation having died, we went to
collect a legacy. We sailed from Brundusium.
The boat was crowded with passengers. Never
shall I forget the day when we sailed from the
Ionian Sea into the Corinthian Gulf, between the
islands Zacynthus and Cephallenia. As we floated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
into the heart of the Iliad, my feelings were preternatural.
It seemed as if my heart were like
a sail which, being swollen by the breath of religion,
drew my soul into a haven of peace.</p>

<p>“It was near sundown,” continued Alcmaeon.
“The sea was calm. The bireme seemed to float
quickly along, like a bird skimming the surface
of the water. The oar-tortured waves grew
white with foamy bubbles. A poet’s eye could
have seen in those waters the breasts and happy
faces of wandering nereids. Across the water
the shadow of Ithaca’s crags extended over the
ship. Through that shadow, as through a violet
mist, I saw the glory of Odysseus.</p>

<p>“That night,” he continued, “we anchored at
Patros. I did not sleep. So enveloped was I in
the glory of the past that the present lost its
identity. I did not live; I dreamed. In the
morning the surface of the sea trembled. The
morning star reflected in the waters, like the
smile of Eos. We raised anchor and proceeded
along the coast.”</p>

<p>As Alcmaeon described his voyage, Hera and
Psyche gazed fixedly at the pale light on the
table. They felt moved by so strange an emotion
that their natural sight was dimmed. As
sorrowful eyes see solace through tears, so Hera
and Psyche saw cheer and a new pleasure in
Alcmaeon’s words. In the intonation with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
he pronounced the old names of towns, heroes,
and gods, they heard, as if floating on a river
of melody, a Parthenic song.</p>

<p>“The bow of the boat cleaved the water like
a swan’s breast,” continued Alcmaeon. “The
historic shores of the gulf unfolded scene after
scene, picture after picture,—all so beautiful in
the dawn that they seemed to be glimpses into
Elysium. The boat seemed to be drawn by an
invisible force; the air seemed to vibrate with
emotion; our hearts beat faster, when suddenly,
like a lightning flash, directly in front, there
sparkled a glorious mountain. The captain
shouted, ‘Parnassus! Parnassus!’ I became
as one transfixed; for in that mountain I saw
the flaming celestial face of the god of the Sun,
Apollo. The weight of humanity burdened me.
I wished to fly to the mountain-tops. Oh! to
have been like the eagle, which from the heights
of heaven flies along the windy ways towards
its nest!</p>

<p>“Soon after, I beheld Aegira, Sicyon, and
finally the home of my ancestors, Corinth. I
saw the Acrocorinthus, and I became lost in an
oblivion of joy. O my Hera! O my Psyche!
above all earthly music, above the song of the
Iliad, there floated to me from that glorious place
the cradle-song of my forefathers.”</p>

<p>At this part of the description Alcmaeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
paused. He smoothed his brow with his hand.
Hera and Psyche bestowed upon him fond
glances, showing their intense sympathy with his
emotion. He continued in a trembling voice:
“We disembarked. We climbed towards the
city. We reached the walls. O ye gods! we
gazed upon the mutilated remains of the once
proud town. The Romans under Mummius and
his swine made of that once glorious city a
trough. Our ancestors were sold into slavery.
Our branch of the family was redeemed.”</p>

<p>Again Alcmaeon paused. The last words he
had uttered were full of irony. He passed his
hand over his eyes and continued: “But these
are bitter recollections. Sing an Homeric song,
O Hera, and thou too, Psyche. Let our dreams
float away from the iron city of Rome to the
celestial cities of the Iliad.”</p>

<p>Hera began to sing an old cradle-song that had
been sung in her family from generation to generation.
It was the same sweet song which, like
gentle fingers, had closed the eyelids of Gannon
and Psyche in the slumber of childhood. Taking
her mother’s hand in hers and smoothing it,
Psyche also sang. Alcmaeon softly added his
deep bass voice to theirs. On the spirit of the
song they were drawn into the land of happy
reveries. From songs they changed to hymns.
So moved was Alcmaeon that he rose from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
couch and seated himself between Hera and
Psyche, with an arm thrown about each of them.
In the sacredness of the words and music they
were supremely happy. Their souls were melted
in religious fervor.</p>

<p>While they were thus singing, they heard a
scratching at the door. The noise sounded like
a cat trying to enter. Alcmaeon opened the
door, and saw on the threshold a poor humpbacked
girl who was trembling and weeping.</p>

<p>“What has happened to thee, Lupa?” he
asked.</p>

<p>When Lupa’s name was spoken, Psyche hastened
to the door. So rough and unmannerly
were the neighbors of Alcmaeon that they were
almost entirely ignored by Alcmaeon and his
family. Lupa was the only exception. The
poor deformed child of eleven was the youngest
of six children. She was cruelly treated by her
family, who looked upon her deformity as a
crime. Psyche was the only one in the neighborhood
who took an interest in the sad, misshapen,
but good-natured girl. In reply to
Alcmaeon’s question, Lupa said, “They have
beaten me.”</p>

<p>“Enter and tell us why, O Lupa,” said
Psyche, gently.</p>

<p>“They gave me a jar of water to carry,”
replied the poor child. “It was too heavy. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
let it fall. To punish me, they beat me, and put
me out of the house for the night.”</p>

<p>“Thou canst rest here. Weep no more. Art
thou hungry?” asked Psyche.</p>

<p>The deformed girl timidly nodded her head.</p>

<p>After arranging a couch for her, Psyche
brought her some bread, and said: “Eat and
sleep in peace, O unhappy Lupa. No one shall
hurt thee here.”</p>

<p>At noon on the following day Alcmaeon’s
house was deserted. Poor Lupa had gone back
to her cheerless home; Alcmaeon was at school;
and Psyche and Hera had gone to the rehearsal
at Pompey’s Theatre.</p>

<p>Of all the celebrations that were to be given
the people by Nero on his arriving at the manly
age, the dancing at Pompey’s Theatre would be
the least exciting. The taste of most Romans
dwelt on vulgarity, on obscene comedy, and on
exciting gladiatorial combat and horse-races.
Still, many delighted in watching the evolutions
of the dance. Psyche was to portray Niobe,—a
sad but beautiful impersonation. As all the
dancers knew their different rôles, the rehearsal
required little repetition. Hera remained only a
short time. Having met Gyges, whom she playfully
called Eros, she left Psyche under his
watchful eyes. These she thought were better
guardians than her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Gyges was no golden-winged, heaven-descended
god, like the mythical protector of the goddess
Psyche, but a rich young charioteer, twenty-two
years old. He was a Greek, and a perfect specimen
of manly strength and symmetry. He had
an oval face, with a pair of sharp, quick black
eyes, a bold nose and forehead, and a small mouth,
with lips that were thick and gracefully curved,—especially
the short upper one, which was shaped
like the bow of Eros. His rich, black curly hair
was cut short. His body was graceful, lithe, and
muscular. He was a living counterpart of the
Hermes of Praxiteles at Olympia. At the races
he always wore the green color; and as that color
was the favorite, the betting odds changed whenever
he drove. His intrepid and daring appearance,
as he stood in the chariot, with the reins
strapped around his body, his right foot resting
on the chariot shield in front of him, his body
bent back, his eyes flashing with fire, his clear
voice shouting to his horses, inspired the spectators
with wild enthusiasm. The excitement and
rush of the chariots, as they rounded the last
turn, with the finish line dead ahead of them,—on,
on, in breathless anxiety, on to victory,—so
thrilled the multitudes that they rose to their
feet and rent the air with cheers.</p>

<p>The parents of Gyges, like those of Psyche,
had been aristocratic Greeks; but having lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
their property, they had moved to Rome to retrieve
their fortune. Both were now dead. The
mother died when Gyges was but a child; the
father but recently. An old freed slave named
Nana took care of the home of Gyges. She had
been a second mother to him. By her tender
care, and through the excellent education and
training given him by his father, he had developed
into worthy and successful manhood. At
the age of sixteen he had mastered the art of
wrestling; but liking horses, and preferring the
excitement of a charioteer’s life, he had taken
racing as a profession. So successful had he
become that he had accumulated a neat fortune
of a million sesterces. On this day Gyges had
left his horses and had come to the rehearsal to
watch Psyche in her fascinating movements. So
delighted was he by her grace and charm that
he frequently broke out with applause. When
the rehearsal was over, and Psyche had received
congratulations from the instructor and
the other dancing-girls, Gyges said to her,
“Truly, O Psyche, never have I seen thee dance
so well.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the character I love best to portray,”
answered Psyche.</p>

<p>“Dost thou feel too tired to walk along the
Via Sacra?”</p>

<p>“All weariness flees at the sight of thee, O<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Gyges,” replied Psyche. “I could walk until
evening.”</p>

<p>In order to reach the Via Sacra, they passed
the Flaminian Circus, walked in the beautiful
pillared porticos of Philippus and Octavia,
passed the Theatre of Marcellus, went through
the Porta Triumphalis, in the Servian wall, and
entered the Forum near the Basilica Julia. The
Forum was crowded. The lovers worked their
way through the busy and noisy throng, and
were soon among the shops that bordered the
Via Sacra.</p>

<p>“What shall I buy thee, O Psyche?” asked
Gyges, when they stopped before a jeweller’s shop.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my Gyges. I wish only to look at
the beautiful objects displayed here.”</p>

<p>“But buying a jewel hinders thee not from
regarding it with admiration.”</p>

<p>“True, O Gyges,” said Psyche, smiling; “but
there are many things for which I have no use.
Look at that chain with the small gold links and
the hyacinth stones in the centre! Is not that
graceful?”</p>

<p>“It may be.”</p>

<p>“Why ‘may be,’ O Gyges?”</p>

<p>“I am no judge of ornament, O Psyche,” replied
Gyges, “unless it be a decoration for harness
or chariot. Sculpture interests me more.
Thine enthusiasm, however, pleases me more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the jewelry. Of a truth, dost thou like the chain
with the hyacinth stones?”</p>

<p>“’Tis beautiful. Thinkest thou it is very
costly?”</p>

<p>“Shall I ask?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” returned Psyche, with a smile.
“Raise not the jeweller’s hopes. What heavy
ear-rings are being worn now! Wouldst thou
not think that they would tear the ear? Jewelry
is not adornment when it disfigures. Dost thou
not think so?”</p>

<p>“Ear-rings please me not,” said Gyges. “Are
not those hair-nets and bands pretty?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Gyges. But look!” she added
quickly. “There is a ring like the one thou
didst buy me. Dost thou remember the day we
saw a similar one in a shop in the Suburra?
Thou didst ask the price. Was not the amount
one-half what thou didst pay here? Thou wert
angry that day.”</p>

<p>“Truly, not angry!” he protested.</p>

<p>“Perchance thou wert provoked,” she playfully
remarked. “Truly, however, we know that
no inferior jewelry is sold here. Thou wilt never
know how proud I was when I heard that my
ring was bought here,—in this shop which senators
and wealthy men patronize. Look there,
Gyges! What a beautiful set of jewels is being
shown that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Softly, my Psyche,” interrupted Gyges.
“The purchaser of those jewels is Nero.”</p>

<p>“What! Nero, who is soon to assume the
manly habit?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Psyche. Wouldst thou like to have
a set like that?”</p>

<p>“Ornament does not make people happy, my
Gyges,” said Psyche, as they left the jeweller’s
shop. “I am happier dressed in plain clothes,
with no ornament, than the women who recline
amidst soft cushions, and who are so loaded with
jewels that they have to be assisted when they
walk. But look yonder! What a quantity of
silk that matron has bought! Doubtless a
daughter is to be wed.”</p>

<p>Gyges greatly enjoyed Psyche’s light chatter.
He allowed her to continue unchecked in her
girlish enthusiasm. Every store they passed
brought forth exclamations of pleasure from
Psyche. She was so busily engaged looking at
some sandals that she did not observe the disappearance
of Gyges. He quickly returned to the
jewelry shop, made a purchase, and was again at
Psyche’s side almost as soon as she missed him.</p>

<p>“Where hast thou been?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I wished to look once more at a jewel,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“And therefore, my Gyges, I have been speaking
to myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“What didst thou say?”</p>

<p>“I was admiring those sandals of colored
leather.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou like them too, O Psyche?” asked
Gyges, laughing. “Surely the Via Sacra is thy
celestial path. Thou standest more patient and
more wrapped in contemplation than in a temple
to a god. But come, let us to the art dealer.
Let us admire the prettiest thing on earth,—the
human form.”</p>

<p>“Behold that small copy of the Faun of Praxiteles,”
said Gyges, when they had arrived before
the sculptor’s shop. “Yonder is a copy of the
Venus of Cnidus and the Hermes of the same
sculptor. But look at this Ares! What a creation
of beauty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what grace, what action!” exclaimed
Psyche.</p>

<p>“Ay,” assented Gyges, “’tis full of life. How
alive and quick are the legs and arms! What sensuous
grace, what soft outlines! Yet how heroic!
’Twas carved by a Greek. The Romans carve
only fortunes and kingdoms.”</p>

<p>“But tell me, why is it not sold?” asked
Psyche.</p>

<p>“I know not. Three months have I seen it
there, begging its price. But tastes have changed,
O Psyche. Busts of the Divine Augustus are
now sought. Then, too, the statues of Tiberius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
when he was a lad are in demand; for his now
hideous face was once handsome. Didst thou
ever see the emperor, my Psyche?”</p>

<p>“Not closely, my Gyges. Gannon says he is
ugly.”</p>

<p>“The emperor may despise the games at the
circus and the gladiatorial combats,” said Gyges,
“but ’twould have been better if he had loved
them more. Probably his face would not now
show the results of his dissolute life. The stories
about him that are slyly circulated in the circus
are terrible, though we are not allowed to speak
of him disrespectfully. Only yesterday my stable-boy,
Aldo, a lad only fifteen years old, was lashed
ten times for using the name of Tiberius in an
oath. Times have changed, O Psyche,—but we
are happy. In a few days thou shalt be the mistress
of a new home. Tell me, what dost thou
wish most for a present?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my Gyges, thou understandest thy horses
better than thou dost a woman’s heart. Joy is
lost in knowing beforehand what gift will be
received.”</p>

<p>“Be it as thou wilt, O Psyche. Some days
ago I told thee that I bought a house. To-day
that house is ready to receive its mistress. Shall
we go there now?”</p>

<p>“O my lover, I have been burning with curiosity
since that day! Nothing would be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
pleasing than to go there now,” said Psyche,
trembling with joy at the prospect of seeing her
future home.</p>

<p>They left the Forum, walked around the Palatine
Hill, and turned down a narrow street near
the Porta Capena. Here they stopped before a
small house.</p>

<p>“This is our new home, O Psyche,” said
Gyges, as he knocked at the door.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Nana, who gladly
welcomed them.</p>

<p>“I have brought the bird for the new cage,
O Nana,” said Gyges.</p>

<p>“Wilt thou make of me a prisoner, my
Gyges?” asked Psyche, with a shy smile.</p>

<p>“The door of this cage will always be open,”
replied Gyges, laughing merrily.</p>

<p>Psyche behaved like a child with a new gift.
Her face was radiant. As each newly furnished
room was shown her, she burst into exclamations
of pleasure. The house consisted of a peristyle,
around which opened five small rooms. In the
centre of the peristyle played a small fountain,
bordered by blooming flowers. At one end a
stone bench, large enough for only two, invitingly
held open its arms. Nana wisely left the
happy lovers alone amid the flowers, and
retired.</p>

<p>“How happy we shall be here, O Gyges!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
said Psyche, throwing her arms around Gyges’
neck and kissing him.</p>

<p>“Dost thou now wonder, O my love,” he responded,
“why the gods and goddesses left the
heavens and came to earth to love mortals?”</p>

<p>The lovers seated themselves on the marble
bench and watched the playing fountain. Borne
on the perfumed breath of the flowers, the splashing
sound of the water affected the lovers with
an indescribable sense of joy. The dancing drops
fell now on one side and then on the other side
of the basin, according as the wind blew against
the spouting jet. In their happy meditations
the lovers saw in the jet of water a life of
pleasure breaking into drops of joy, and reflecting,
after it fell into the basin, the radiant
heavens. Everything about them was cheerful,
bright, and sunny. The lovers remained quiet
and thoughtful. They built mental pictures on
the peaceful background of their new home.
Gyges broke the silence by saying, as he kissed
her hand, “What beautiful hands thou hast, O
my love!”</p>

<p>“They are no less finely moulded than thine
are, O my lover. But thy fingers and wrists are
strong as iron; mine are more supple.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my love; thine can be broken like a
tender flower. These hands must never grow
hard and coarse. Nana will do all the hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
work. Then thou must find some one to help
thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt spoil me, O Gyges. Nana and I
can do everything.”</p>

<p>“Why canst thou not bring Lupa here? She
would have a happy home with us.”</p>

<p>“Poor unfortunate child!” said Psyche. “Last
night she was beaten and put out of her home.
We cared for her. Canst thou, O Gyges, provide
for so many people?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my love,” said Gyges, cheerfully.
“Charioteers are well paid. I am doubly fortunate
in being a favorite with the people.
When we tire of this house, we can buy another
better, larger, grander.”</p>

<p>“Shall we end by living on the Palatine Hill,
O my lover?” laughed Psyche.</p>

<p>“Not so high are my ambitions,” said Gyges,
with a smile. “I must always see my Psyche
beautiful, free from care and trouble. I must
always see on her cheek the rosy bloom which
I shall try to brush away with kisses. Lay thy
head on my shoulder. My lips thirst for kisses,
O my love. Let me press thine eyes with my
lips. Let me press thy lips with mine. Are we
not happy?”</p>

<p>“Never was the beloved of Eros happier than
I am with thee now, O my lover.”</p>

<p>“For the wish to kiss lips like thine, O my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
love, the Trojan war was fought. The desire
for a kiss changed Arethusa into a fountain,
Daphne into the aromatic laurel-tree, Adonis
into the tremulous flower of the wind. A kiss,
my love, is the knot that unites the cords of
love, and therefore completes the circle of
happiness.”</p>

<p>While Psyche rested on her lover’s bosom,
Gyges slyly placed in her hand the package
which he had carried from the jeweller’s. Feeling
the object in her hand, Psyche started.</p>

<p>“What is that, O my lover?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Thou didst not like the ear-rings, my love.
Perhaps thou wilt like a golden hair-net.”</p>

<p>“Whilst I looked at the sandals thou didst buy
a present?” she asked, as she carefully opened
the package.</p>

<p>“Ay, my love. A golden hair-net will require
to—”</p>

<p>“A golden hair-net! Why, ’tis the necklace
with the hyacinth stones!” she cried with delight.
“O my lover, thou art too, too good to
me!”</p>

<p>She seated herself on his knees and mutely
expressed her thanks in the kisses she gave him.</p>

<p>They relapsed into silence, the happy medium
in which the hearts of lovers beat. ’Tis in silence
that the leaves whisper their secrets to the gentle
zephyrs. ’Tis in silence that the butterflies tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
their thoughts to the flowers. The blossoms pour
their mysterious perfume on the wings of the air
in silence. It was in silence that Aphrodite stole
the slumbering Ascanius from his home. She
laid him on a bank of violets shaded by bushes
covered with luxuriant roses, bent in reverence
before his beauty.</p>

<p>Psyche and Gyges, silently clasped in each
other’s arms, had become transcendent beings.
Sacred reveries filled their souls. The bridge
over which they walked from the past to the
future was one of gold. The stream that flowed
beneath was one of crystal joy. The sun that
filled their lives was at its zenith. They seemed
to hear an Hellenic song. It was the music of
their souls, singing the song of beatific love.</p>

<p>Long they sat there, lost in happiness. Gyges
suddenly gave a start, and exclaimed: “Look,
O my love! The fountain has stopped playing.”</p>

<p>They hastened to the fountain to see why the
water had ceased flowing. Gyges found a small
fish caught in the opening. The little fish was
dead.</p>

<p>“What means this omen?” he asked, in a tone
of sadness.</p>

<p>There flashed upon his mind that so, too, the
spontaneous flow of their happiness, which he had
so lately likened to the play of the fountain, might
be checked by death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Is the fish dead?” she asked, affrighted.</p>

<p>“Ay, my love.” Then, after a long silence, he
added with an air of sad conviction, “Some one
whom we love is dead.”</p>

<p>“Say not so, O lover,” cried Psyche. “This
cannot mean anything to us. But look! Even
the sun has left us.”</p>

<p>“Evening is drawing near,” he sadly responded.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go home,” said Psyche, tearfully.</p>

<p>Silently they took a last look at their new
home, said farewell to Nana, went out into the
street, and proceeded along the Via Appia.
When they reached the street that led to
Psyche’s home, they concluded to walk farther
and view the Campagna and the hills beyond,
lit up by the setting sun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Hera left Pompey’s Theatre, she
went directly home. On the way pleasant
recollections of her children filled her mind.
She recalled Psyche as a little child. Once more
she heard with the ear of imagination difficult
Greek words childishly syllabled on Psyche’s lips.
She heard again her childish voice strained with
excessive happiness, singing an old Greek song.
She recalled her childish expressions of joy and
of sorrow. She thought of the small wooden
doll that Psyche had loved like a mother; of
the toys and household objects endeared to the
whole family by association with Psyche’s childhood.
She thought of Psyche in the religious
festivals,—a little child, clad in pure white, her
face suffused with holy zeal. She thought of her
later, when Psyche led the chorus of youths and
maidens, all carrying garlands of roses and
daisies, and singing sacred melodies to Maia,
goddess of spring.</p>

<p>But when Psyche ceased to take part in the
festivals, when maidenhood dimmed the radiance
of childhood, that was the first vapor which veiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the sun of Hera’s happiness. However, this waning
light of childhood merged almost imperceptibly
into the silvery light of Psyche’s public
career. Now even this was to be shadowed;
for womanhood, like a semi-transparent shade
of alabaster, would forever obscure the light of
maidenhood.</p>

<p>As she walked along, she was so occupied in
contemplation that she passed a shrine of Apollo
without offering a prayer. When she became
aware of this omission, she was filled with anxious
forebodings. To omit praying at Apollo’s
shrine was a bad omen.</p>

<p>But again her thoughts reverted to her children.
Her heart’s love belonged to them. This
time she thought especially of Gannon. Once
again she followed him through all the changes
of his young life. The first smile, the little outstretched
hands, the first trembling footsteps, the
loving caresses to her cheek, the tearful eyes,—all
these pictures presented themselves to her.
She heard his broken words echo in her ears, his
complaints, his songs, and cries of joy. How her
heart beat with delight when she saw her children
in the innocent ecstasies of play! How she had
smiled at their childish ideas!</p>

<p>As she walked along, a wan-faced woman who
was quieting a sickly child held out her scrawny
hand for alms, saying, “For the love of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Mother of God, give me food for my dying
child!”</p>

<p>Hera stopped, looked at the wan face of the
mother, then at the miserable, sickly child, whose
lips were nearly as white as the curds of milk
in its half-open mouth. She pressed a piece of
money into the mother’s hand. At that moment
the babe convulsively moved, gave a feeble cry,
rolled its eyes, and then grew rigid. The child
died before Hera’s eyes. The poor mother
shrieked with anguish. Hera trembled. The
unsaid prayers at Apollo’s shrine and the sight
of the dead child were the most ominous signs
that had ever come into her experience. She
silently went her way, deeply impressed by these
warnings. She wished for some one to talk to.
“Would that Alcmaeon or Psyche were only
with me!” she said to herself.</p>

<p>If Hera’s heart beat for her children, her love
for Alcmaeon was the power that controlled the
pulsations. Her soul belonged to him. But her
life was completely wrapped up in her family.
Rarely did she see or talk with any one but them.
Her life had been one bright summer in the sunshine
of their love. No dark cloud had shadowed
her life as yet, and no cloud was visible on the
horizon of her happiness. To counteract the evil
effects of the warnings she had received, she softly
sung a hymn as she walked along. So absorbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was she in contemplation that she did not observe
two soldiers before her, carrying a litter. She
did not even see them when they turned down
her street. But when they stopped before her
house, she hastened forward in alarm.</p>

<p>While she quickly opened the door and helped
them place the litter on the table, she anxiously
asked them what had happened. They told her
that an accident had befallen Gannon. Thinking
that he was only injured, she tremblingly drew
back the cover. She beheld the dead face of her
dear son. She uttered a piercing shriek of horror
and despair. Her cry aroused the neighbors, who
collected around the door and curiously looked
inside. The distracted mother quickly closed the
door. Wringing her hands, she asked, in a voice
broken by sobs, how he had died. In a dazed
manner she gathered from the replies of the soldiers
that at midnight, while on the roof of the
camp, he had lost his balance and had fallen to
the ground.</p>

<p>The distance between her happy recollections
of the past and the tragic events of the present
was too great to be traversed by Hera’s mind in
so short a time. Her heart felt heavy, like a
stone falling into dark waters. Alone with her
grief, she felt afraid. In falling, Gannon had
broken his neck. The only marks on his body
were a gash on the back of his head and bruises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
around his neck. His uninjured, handsome face
was white, but natural in expression. The
wretched mother looked into his face. She
touched and petted it. She covered it with tears
and kisses. She touched his hands, but they
were cold and stiff. She hastily drew hers back.
Nearly beside herself, she threw her arms around
him. Shedding tears and moaning his name, she
trembled above him. At last she lost her powers
of self-control and swooned away.</p>

<p>While Hera lay over the body of Gannon,
Lupa entered. Learning from the gossip of the
neighbors that some one was dead, she knocked
on Alcmaeon’s door. As no one answered, she
opened it and whispered Psyche’s name. Not
hearing a reply the second time, she entered, and
saw Hera prostrate upon a body which lay on
a litter. She quietly approached and lightly
touched her. There was no response. She
called aloud, “O Hera, Hera!” and shook her.
Hera slowly returned to consciousness and looked
vacantly around the room. When she saw Lupa’s
homely face so full of sympathy, she whispered
that Gannon was dead. Lupa made no reply.
Throwing her long arms around Hera’s neck,
she sobbed aloud. Soon after, they heard some
one outside. It was Alcmaeon, coming home
from school.</p>

<p>“Hail, wife!” he cheerfully sang out, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
opened the door. But the happy words of greeting
had hardly died on his lips when he saw
Hera and Lupa weeping. Hera quickly ran to
meet him; Lupa slipped quietly out of the room.
Through tears and sobs Hera then told him the
terrible news. He seemed stunned. He looked
upon Gannon’s face and walked away. So greatly
shocked was he that at first he did not understand
the weight of his affliction. Gradually its
full force descended upon his heart with crushing
power. He could not weep. He groaned.
He began to rave. He looked to heaven and
called upon the gods. When he became more
calm, he said with a trembling voice, “This
was no accident, O wife! This was no
accident!”</p>

<p>“Why, what meanest thou, O husband?”</p>

<p>“When didst thou say he was on the roof?”
he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“At midnight,” she replied.</p>

<p>“How came he on the roof at that time unless
he was ordered?” he asked, more suspicious than
before.</p>

<p>“I know not, O husband.”</p>

<p>“Has he not told us that after his dinner ’twas
his custom to work until he went to bed? The
night was not warm, O Hera. Believe me, he
was ordered there,” said Alcmaeon, with an air
of conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Ay; then ’twas an unusual command.”</p>

<p>“Hearken unto me, O wife. Gannon has been
murdered!” exclaimed Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“Say not so, O Alcmaeon!” said Hera, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ay, murdered!” repeated Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“But who would wish him harm?” she asked
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Have I not always said there might be danger
in knowing a secret? Woe to him who knows a
secret in that den of murderers! Gannon has
learned one. This secret has been one that even
prison walls could not keep quiet. Death was the
only way to silence him,” groaned Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“O Alcmaeon! Woe is on our house!” cried
Hera.</p>

<p>“Ay, Hera. Gannon did not fall; he was
thrown. Mark thou, Hera, ’twas a crime, a
crime! O Zeus and ye other eternal gods, avenge
this dastardly deed!” he called to heaven.</p>

<p>“A curse is upon Greece and her people,” said
Hera.</p>

<p>“Ay, a curse is upon us, O Hera,” added
Alcmaeon. “And how can a schoolmaster contend
against such men? Ah, we must live
silently. We must bow our heads without raising
a revengeful hand. Oh! is this not worse
than slavery?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Ah, Alcmaeon! Oh that we might have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
some word from him, some last word that we
could forever remember!” she said, weeping.</p>

<p>“No doubt the dear lad tried to send us word,
but he could not.”</p>

<p>Alcmaeon now approached the table. He drew
away entirely the cloth that covered the dead body
of his son. He looked lovingly into Gannon’s
face. His eyes began to float in tears as the
memories of his dear boy surged through his
mind; he completely broke down and sobbed like
a child.</p>

<p>“Why should I have lived to see this day,
O Hera?” he cried. “There has gone from my
life a light that can never again shine upon my
way. My hopes lie shattered there. O Zeus and
ye eternal gods, send solace to a household burdened
with so great a calamity!” he prayed.</p>

<p>Recovering his self-command, the stricken
father tenderly removed Gannon’s tunic, and
handing it to Hera, procured a basin of water
and bathed Gannon’s body. Hera took the tunic,
which she shook and folded. While they were
thus employed, Alcmaeon was startled by hearing
his wife call: “Come quickly, O husband!
Here, inside Gannon’s tunic, is some writing!”</p>

<p>In an instant Alcmaeon was at his wife’s side,
and read excitedly the words, “Have done wrong.
Read a letter from L to S about Lygdus.” “Ah,
said I not so, O wife?” he cried. “He learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a secret. Ah, the poor lad turned his thoughts
to his family before he died. While we were
singing hymns yester eve, he was in trouble. O
my dear, dear son! Why did I ever take thee
to the camp? O my son, my son!”</p>

<p>“But what means the ‘L to S’?” asked Hera,
when Alcmaeon had again become quiet.</p>

<p>“I know not. The ‘S’ must mean Sejanus.
But who is Lygdus?”</p>

<p>“Is not Lygdus the eunuch that Gannon disliked,
O husband?” asked Hera.</p>

<p>“Ay, I remember,” said Alcmaeon, shaking
his head. “But what means the ‘L’?”</p>

<p>“Gannon has mentioned no name that begins
with an ‘L’ except that of Livilla,” said Hera.</p>

<p>“True, O Hera. ’Tis Livilla,” said Alcmaeon,
as if convinced. “Ah, so Sejanus and Livilla are
conspiring! But hold, wife! What is this that
Gannon has done?” asked Alcmaeon, in a tone
of fear.</p>

<p>“What dost thou mean, O Alcmaeon?” cried
Hera.</p>

<p>“Ah, my son, thou hast told us the same secret
that caused thy death! O Hera! we are as guilty
as the dead lad! Not a word to any one of what
thou hast read! Where is Psyche?”</p>

<p>“She is with Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a sad home-coming for the dear
child! But tell her not of the writing, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Hera! Let that knowledge be forever sealed in
thy memory.”</p>

<p>Greatly excited and impressed by the writing
on Gannon’s tunic, Alcmaeon stationed himself
again by the body of his murdered son. Hera
took the tunic and began to tear away the cloth
that bore Gannon’s message. Suddenly they
heard the tramping of feet outside the door.
They were startled when the door was thrust
open and an officer of the Praetorians entered
and said, “The inhabitants of this house are
under arrest.”</p>

<p>Not having finished detaching the message,
Hera dropped the tunic and ran to Alcmaeon,
who rose, exclaiming, “Ye gods! What have
we done?”</p>

<p>“A soldier never questions his orders. There
is a daughter; where is she?” demanded the
officer.</p>

<p>“She will be home at sundown,” replied Alcmaeon.
“But what does this mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that thou and thy wife must immediately
go with me to the Praetorian Camp,”
replied the officer, in a rough tone.</p>

<p>“But the body of my dead son is unburied!
How long shall we be detained?” asked Alcmaeon,
pitifully.</p>

<p>“I have orders to care for Gannon’s body,”
said the officer. “You must leave at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“But may we not wait for our daughter?”
pleaded Hera.</p>

<p>“No. We leave at once,” repeated the officer,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Ordering two soldiers to await Psyche, and two
others to carry Gannon’s body to a crematory,
the officer gave the command to depart. The
grief-stricken and terrified parents, after taking
a heart-breaking farewell of their beloved son,
were then led away.</p>

<p>Sejanus was dictating a letter when Alcmaeon
and Hera were led into his office. They were
obliged to wait until he had finished. Before the
murderer of his son Alcmaeon trembled; before
the great Sejanus the schoolmaster felt like a
child. Hera tightly held Alcmaeon’s arm in hers
and talked to him in a subdued but nervous tone.
She was repeatedly warned by Alcmaeon not to
acknowledge having seen the writing on Gannon’s
tunic. At last they were ordered to come
forward. Sejanus addressed Alcmaeon first, saying,
“Thy son is dead.”</p>

<p>“Ay, O great Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“He was impertinent.”</p>

<p>“Say not so, O Sejanus—”</p>

<p>“Ay, impertinent; and he inquisitively pried
into my letters.”</p>

<p>“Truly, O Sejanus!” exclaimed Alcmaeon,
greatly surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“What has he told thee?” asked Sejanus, in
a rough tone.</p>

<p>“Nothing; he was—”</p>

<p>Sejanus impatiently interrupted him. “Having
read important letters, he has told thee
nothing?”</p>

<p>“Of a truth, he told us nothing, O Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“I believe thee not,” said Sejanus. He turned
to Hera and asked her the same questions, and
received the same replies that Alcmaeon had
given. Wishing to terrify them into a declaration,
he continued: “Ye both have lied. Fairly
have ye been treated. One more chance will I
give ye. What knowest thou, O Alcmaeon?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Alcmaeon, emphatically.</p>

<p>“And thou, woman?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” timidly replied the stricken mother.</p>

<p>“If you insist on lying, so be it. We sometimes
torture in the camp when we wish to know
the truth,” thundered Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Have we not suffered enough, O Sejanus?”
cried Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>But Hera, becoming hysterical at this announcement
of Sejanus, revealed what they had
read on Gannon’s tunic before Alcmaeon could
prevent her.</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h!” sarcastically laughed Sejanus.
“Gannon has lied to me! His death was an
accident. Your knowledge carries with it its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
own sentence. Your death will not be by accident.
But no! Close confinement will suffice
for the present.”</p>

<p>At this announcement, made in the most cold-blooded
manner, Gannon’s parents became horror-stricken.
Hera convulsively held to Alcmaeon,
who tried to soothe her. The father bore this
new affliction with more fortitude than he showed
at the announcement of his son’s death.</p>

<p>“Where is thy daughter?” asked Sejanus.</p>

<p>“O great Sejanus, she knows nothing!” cried
Alcmaeon. “She had not yet arrived home when
we left.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” said Sejanus. He called a soldier
and gave this order: “Take these prisoners
and place them in a cell together, in close confinement.
Go.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had they left when he called another
soldier, and ordered him to bring to the camp
Gannon’s tunic. “With that destroyed,” he said
to himself, “there will be no evidence against us.”
He rubbed his hands and smiled at the course
events were taking. He called for his litter and
a small body-guard. Then, sinking back among
the luxurious cushions of his litter, he commanded
imperiously: “To the Palatine!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A CROWD of magistrates, proconsuls, priests,
Senators, and ambassadors were in the
polished-marble council chamber in a sumptuous
palace on the Palatine Hill. Seated on a curule
chair on a raised platform was a man sixty-two
years old. His face was handsome, but disfigured
with pimples and plasters. His eyes were large
and, like those of a bat, could see in the dark. His
lips were thick, puffy, and usually moist and
shiny. His stern forehead was so furrowed by
a frown that his eyebrows touched. His long
hair fell upon and greased his toga. His figure
was large and robust, his bearing erect; he held
his head stiff and upright. Around his neck, over
his imperial tunic, he wore a golden chain studded
with jewels. As he sat there he was approached,
from time to time, by different men who respectfully
bowed and proffered words of salutation.
From his demeanor and the manner of those
who addressed him it might be inferred that he
had no higher rank than that of a consul. Yet
the man seated there was feared and hated by
every one. He was the most powerful man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the Roman Empire. He was the Emperor,
Tiberius!</p>

<p>His early life had been full of disappointment.
As step-son to the Divine Augustus he always
considered himself worthy of great honors. His
aspiring hopes, however, were continually shattered.
Augustus, marrying his daughter Julia
to his nephew Marcellus, had first adopted Marcellus
as his heir. When that unfortunate youth
died, Augustus married Julia to Agrippa, and
then adopted Julia’s second husband as his heir.
Agrippa dying and leaving five children, Augustus
then adopted as heirs two older sons of Agrippa.
Tiberius was then compelled to divorce his wife
Vipsania, and to marry the twice-widowed Julia.</p>

<p>While married to Julia he became so gloomy,
sullen, and disappointed that, hating the sight of
relations and friends thus forced upon him, he
voluntarily exiled himself from Rome and lived
alone at Rhodes. At that time he was thirty-seven
years old. His actions were so childish
that he sulked, and hid himself even from friends
who passed through Rhodes on their way to the
East. To give an appearance of honorable distinction
to the exile, Livia, his mother, succeeded
in obtaining the title of lieutenant for him. However,
such a lewd and vicious life did he lead at
Rhodes that the Rhodians insulted him and hurled
down his statues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>But Livia worked strenuously for her son.
Years before, the death of Marcellus had been
accomplished. Now, while her son corrupted the
youth of Rhodes, Caius and Lucius were both
mysteriously murdered. Tiberius and “Little
Agrippa,” as he is sometimes called, the third
and last son of Agrippa and Julia, were then
conjointly adopted by Augustus. But the young
Agrippa was cunningly surrounded by such
wicked companions that he became demented
and was exiled to an island called Planasia.
Thus Tiberius finally became the last reluctant
choice of the old emperor.</p>

<p>During the mild reign of Augustus the malevolence
of Tiberius was restrained. The sullenness
of the heir was hidden behind the benign
and resplendent deeds of the benefactor. But
after the death of Augustus the accumulated evil
that had been dammed up for so many years
burst forth with terrific violence. The deaths of
Marcellus, Caius, and Lucius were secretly accomplished.
Now the poor Agrippa was openly
murdered. The hand of outrage was then stayed,
but for only a short time. The good and loyal
Germanicus, the beloved of the Roman people,
was the next victim. He was poisoned in Syria.
But this only whetted the appetite for crime and
intensified the thirst for blood. It seemed as if
the infernal region had at last found a medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
through which to pour forth its Stygian essences;
for when Tiberius sat on the throne the Roman
people became submerged in intemperance, felony,
and licentiousness, confiscations, pillage, and robbery,
envy, hatred, and murder.</p>

<p>Although he behaved deferentially to the Senate,
prefixing his remarks when he addressed
them with “By your leave,” “With your permission,”
etc., yet that servile body dared not
assert its rights, but cringingly obeyed his every
request. He detested vice in others, but he himself
was saturated with abominations. He also
detested men pre-eminent in virtue, because of
the unfavorable light in which they placed him.
He financially helped some Senators, but others
he mercilessly robbed and murdered. Few men
were trusted by him. He was taciturn, and rarely
smiled an honest smile. He was suspicious of
every one. He hated flattery. Gladiatorial combats
he prohibited; yet he watched men tortured
to death with no nice compunction at seeing blood
thus spilt. His soul was filled with evil which
was reflected in all his acts. He was gloomy,
revengeful, and unforgiving. He was easy to
anger. He never forgot an injury. His acts of
tyranny were covered by the cloak of hypocrisy.
He was a heavy drinker, a profligate, an insatiable,
bloody tyrant.</p>

<p>In the council chamber of the palace the emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
had just received a foreign delegation.
Orientals clad in silken robes, embroidered with
gold and silver, mingled with the high Roman
officials, clad in their soft white togas bordered
with purple. Both costumes were imposing in
their different styles,—the one luxuriously royal,
the other regal in its proud simplicity. Among
the Romans present were the young sons of
Agrippina,—Nero and Drusus. These young
princes, grandsons of the Divine Augustus, were
loved for their manly virtues and for the veneration
in which their murdered father, Germanicus,
was held by the Roman people. The simple
and childlike brother of Livilla, Claudius, walked
among the guests, smiling at the nods of recognition,
as if they were great favors bestowed
upon him. Drusus, the son of Tiberius, was
present. Although he was angered at the wrong
done him by his father in the Senate that day,
yet he forced a respectful tone when he addressed
him.</p>

<p>“Is not the audience at an end, O father?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Ay, my son, ’tis over; but I would see Sejanus
before the delegation leaves.”</p>

<p>Drusus slightly frowned when the name of
Sejanus was pronounced. But smothering his
resentment, he said: “Thy presence, O father,
is expected on the Esquiline this night. Fail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
us not. Many days have passed since thou hast
honored my home.”</p>

<p>“Gladly will I be there, O my son,” said
Tiberius.</p>

<p>“Let nothing hinder thee,” persisted Drusus.</p>

<p>“I will be there. But why art thou so
anxious?”</p>

<p>“I have much to tell thee,” replied the wronged
son.</p>

<p>“Thou hast complaints to make?”</p>

<p>“Nay, O father. We shall drink the cup of
peace.”</p>

<p>“I have told thee I will be there. But what
makes Claudius so happy to-day, O my son?”</p>

<p>“He is promised some amphorae from Velletri.
He is partial to the wine of that district,”
replied Drusus, with a mechanical smile.</p>

<p>“Happy Claudius!” said Tiberius, working his
fingers as he talked and giving to all his words
a nasal twang. “Happy Claudius, who lives only
for his stomach!”</p>

<p>An attendant here announced to Tiberius that
Livia was in the vestibule and would enter.</p>

<p>“Tell my mother, Livia,” said Tiberius, the
frown on his forehead deepening, “that I will
not see her to-day.”</p>

<p>But the order was futile. Livia had already
walked into the council chamber and was directing
her way towards the tribunal on which Tiberius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
was seated. The people had respectfully
divided, leaving a passage for her. The attendant
approached her and gave her the reply of
Tiberius. Livia received the rebuke, but continued
on her way.</p>

<p>The mother of Tiberius was eighty years old.
She was a remarkable woman. Her face, although
wrinkled, was yet full of healthy color;
her eyes were bright and piercing; her hair was
white. She walked upright, her bearing full of
dignity.</p>

<p>Tiberius hastily rose and went to meet her.
The swelling veins on his forehead and the red
color of his face showed his anger, yet he dared
not use violent words before such a gathering.
Watching the quiet dignity of the aged mother
and the smothered anger of the enraged son,
the guests remained spellbound. Controlling his
anger, Tiberius requested her to meet him on the
morrow. The wronged mother, however, braved
his displeasure and demanded an immediate audience.
They retired into an adjoining room.
Livia was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“In the Senate to-day thou didst insult me,
O Tiberius!” she slowly said, in an injured tone.</p>

<p>“’Twas not meant as an insult, O mother,”
he snarled.</p>

<p>“Then see that thy words are expunged from
the records of the Senate,” she majestically commanded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
“Know, O son, that before a body of
august men an insult to a Roman matron, ay,
to thy mother, rebounds with redoubled force
upon thee. An official position for a friend was
my small request. But thou, childish and bitter
as thou art, didst say unto the Senate that the
position had been extorted from thee by me.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ’tis true. I like not thy friend,” whined
the emperor.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, thou likest not honesty!” firmly
declared the aged mother.</p>

<p>“Say rather, O mother, that I have courage
to refuse to be responsible for thy friends,” he
jeered.</p>

<p>“Nay. The brothels and wine-shops are the
schools from which men are chosen to office in
these degenerate days,” said Livia, in a tone of
disgust.</p>

<p>“The brothels and wine-shops have truly
educated great men,” he snarled. “But why
didst thou choose this hour to pour out thy
complaints?”</p>

<p>“I wish that thou shouldst withdraw thy words
of to-day at the meeting of the Senate on the
morrow,” she commanded. “I go not to the
house of Drusus this night.”</p>

<p>“That I will not do,” he emphatically declared.</p>

<p>“Then let the people and history judge of thy
worthlessness and thy puerile nature,” she loudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
exclaimed. “But tell me, O son of evil, why wilt
thou not oblige me?”</p>

<p>“Already have I told thee. I like not thy
friend.”</p>

<p>“He was trusted by thy divine step-father.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my mother. But now <i>I</i> conduct the
affairs of the empire.”</p>

<p>“Let me but speak to the people, let me but
unfold to them thy nature, and thy power will
crumble like a child’s sand-hill before the rising
tide of the ocean,” threatened the mother.</p>

<p>“Ah! Once did I fear thee, but never more,”
drawled Tiberius. “Once I wished thy help,
but now thy opinions in affairs of state are no
longer sought. Hereafter <i>my</i> wishes shall be
observed.”</p>

<p>“Thou mockest me, thou tauntest me, O Tiberius!”
she cried. “I care not for the loss of
power. But public insult is something I cannot
and will not endure. Never did the Divine
Augustus so treat me, and thou shalt not. Ingrate
that thou art! no grain of respect or gratitude
lives in thy bitter nature. But am I, the wife
and the mother of an emperor, to be buffeted
about by a thing that associates with the rabble
of the street? Am I—”</p>

<p>“Hold, mother!” interrupted Tiberius. “I
am thy son. Inheritance has left some marks
upon me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Ah! Inheritance is the cloak behind which
cowards hide,” she said with bitter emphasis.</p>

<p>“’Twas not I, O mother, who counselled the
death of Agrippa,” he pettishly argued.</p>

<p>“’Twas thou who gavest the order,” she replied
in a taunting tone. “Did Germanicus, the pure,
unstained son of Antonia, fall by any wish of
mine? His crime was the love he inspired in
the hearts of the people. A comparison between
his purity and thy uncleanness was more than
thou couldst endure. O Tiberius, corruption
crowns thy brow! The pimples on thy face are
words that all can read. Goodness flees before
thee. Joy is strangled in thy presence. Love—”</p>

<p>“Hold!” cried Tiberius, bursting with anger.
“Defy me not, O Livia! Thou wearest the honored
crown of age, but before abusive words
respect flees.”</p>

<p>“Thy respect for me, cruel son, died when I
placed thee where thou art!”</p>

<p>“Of a truth, O mother Livia, my respect for
thee was not increased when I heard, three days
ago, of thy actions the night before.”</p>

<p>“O spiteful son! O villanous man! Whilst
thou didst sleep off the effects of wine, I ran
into the Forum and exhorted the men to extinguish
the flames in the house of the Vestal
Virgins.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ’tis not a creditable deed for <i>the wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and the mother of an emperor</i> to run through the
streets crying for help. I care not if it were for
the cause of extinguishing flames in the Vestals’
house. ’Tis not becoming thy sex. But thou art
forever interfering in affairs that do not belong
to thee. Ah, it tires me,” said Tiberius, with
bitter disgust.</p>

<p>“Such words to me!—to one who fostered
thee, and labored so diligently for thy welfare!”
said Livia, astounded at the air he was assuming.
“Insolence, shameless effrontery, are, then, the
reward for my tireless struggles for thee. But
what more should I expect from a hateful child?
I gave birth to a thing that has become a monstrosity,—a
vile creature, void of all human instinct,—a
brazen-faced serpent that now stings
me. Ah, ingrate that thou art! Well did the
Divine Augustus understand thy malignant disposition.
Here, here, are the letters which he
wrote and which I have cherished. Read what
he says of thee. He calls thee ‘a canker feeding
on his happiness,’ ‘a thorn in his flesh.’ He says,
‘Thy looks are bitter, thy words gall.’ He says,
‘Thy exile at Rhodes is a relief from thy revolting
and disgusting manners.’ He also says, ‘Thy
friends are the dregs of the slums, thy filth a
stain on his household.’ Read, O wicked Tiberius,
what he says of thee, and then ponder over thine
infernal life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Her deliberate and commanding manner and
the reproachful and sarcastic tone in which she
delivered the last few lines of invective so stung
Tiberius that he ground his teeth in rage. She
was magnificent in her self-control. He recoiled
at her words, which, being sharpened by truth,
pierced his very soul. He took up the letters
which she had thrown near his feet, and began to
destroy them, one by one. His face was purple,
and the veins on his forehead were swollen to an
abnormal size. Quelling the blasphemy that
mounted to his lips, and drawling his words
with a repulsive twang, he said: “Thou revilest
me with letters written by a jealous man?
Thou—”</p>

<p>“Have a care, O Tiberius!” she interrupted.
“Revile not the gods. The Romans will not permit
the name of the Divine Augustus to be vilified
by thee. <i>I</i> will not permit thee!”</p>

<p>“Then leave me! I cannot listen to thee and
remain calm. I may strike thee. ’Tis the first
time thou hast dared to thus defy me. ’Twill be
the last. Leave me, O Livia!”</p>

<p>“I will leave thee,” said Livia, magnificent in
the control of her temper and actions; “but before
I depart I will speak some final words.” Her
voice was clear and loud as she added: “Woe unto
thee, O Tiberius! No astrologer is required to
read thy future. ’Tis written on thy evil face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
The furrows upon thy brow will deepen. Thy
night-seeing, vampire-like eyes will delight in the
sight of blood. In thy nostrils will be the stench
of the putrefying corpses of thy murdered victims.
Thy mouth will be red-stained like that of the
Cyclops, not by wine, but by the blood of innocent
wretches. ’Twill no longer be the face of a
human being, ’twill be the sodden despotic face
of a monster.”</p>

<p>“Have done, O Livia! have done!” cried
Tiberius.</p>

<p>“I will speak. Woe unto thee, Tiberius! Thy
life will be more unhappy, if that were possible.
Rome, that was happy under the Divine Augustus,
will rise and execrate thee. Sejanus, who
helps thee in thy infernal plans, carries a scorpion
sting behind his smooth and polished servility.
Thou shalt dwell in miserable solitude,—in a
solitude that shall resound with the yells of the
despairing, with the shrieks of the tortured, and
with the groans of the dying. Hate has become
incarnate in thee. Murder, dripping with blood,
will be thy spouse.”</p>

<p>“By the eternal gods, cease this tirade! By
Hercules—” he cried, as if to strike her.</p>

<p>“Ay, strike me! Strike thine old mother, who
has lived too long! Oh that I should have lived to
see this unhappy day! But woe unto thee, Tiberius!
Thy relations all suffer under the pall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
thy displeasure. Thy mother is insulted. Thy
son is denied his just rights. Thy adopted
daughter, Agrippina, and her children tremble
in fear of thee. The pious Antonia’s eyes are red
with weeping for her son Germanicus. Only the
insanity of Claudius protects him against thy hate.
The wretched Roman people are becoming enslaved
by thy dastardly system of spies. Are thy
kinsmen all wrong? Are the people also wrong?
Art thou, and thou only, the one who is right?
Woe unto thee, O infamous son! I have finished.
Would that my words should always ring in
thine ears! Woe unto thee; I repeat it,—woe
unto thee!”</p>

<p>Saying these words, Livia raised her arms to
heaven as if she were invoking a curse. She
walked slowly to the door and entered the council
chamber. Her face was flushed, and her lips
slightly trembled, but her step was firm. As she
smiled and bowed to those whom she recognized
among the crowd, her bearing was full of composure,
dignity, and majesty.</p>

<p>Instead of becoming angry at the last words
of Livia, Tiberius sneered and smiled sarcastically.
Not wishing to appear before the guests,
he sent word that the audience was at an
end.</p>

<p>When Sejanus arrived at the palace, he was
immediately received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Hail to thee, O Tiberius!” said the minister,
as he entered the room.</p>

<p>“Thank the gods, thou hast at last appeared,
O faithful minister!” said Tiberius, giving a deep
sigh of relief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LIKE a flabby, living tumor, with slimy, infernal
eyes and terrific sucking tentacles
that draw like death, that most repulsive and
revolting of all animals, the octopus, folds itself
in the shadowy recesses of a rock. It floats on the
waters. It hides amidst the foliage of the sea.
With the quintessence of cunning it watches and
waits for its prey. The sucking arms dart out like
a flash at the approach of a victim, which, after
a short struggle, is ground to pieces in the rapacious
jaws of the monster. After the meal the
swelling paunch palpitates with satisfaction. The
octopus then retreats, and awaits the appearance
of another victim. When another one of its own
ilk draws near, it makes of that other a companion,
but in the companionship the stronger rules the
weaker. A compact is formed. They repose,
watch, and work together.</p>

<p>Such a nefarious compact existed between
Tiberius and Sejanus. They skilfully watched,
cunningly deceived, and malignantly intrigued
together. Both were fearless, yet they worked
their designs in a cowardly manner. With evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
instinct Tiberius divined the true nature of Sejanus.
The true pulsations of the inner heart of
Sejanus, in spite of his different moods and
actions, were known and felt by Tiberius. No
gentle testing was needed between two such
natures. They met and immediately recognized
each other. No circumlocution was necessary;
they spoke directly and plainly. As two equally
pitched sounds of a discordant note vibrate in
unison and assimilate, so did these two natures.
Malignity, violence, and cruelty were the sounds
they made and heard with equal zest and intelligence.
But day by day the emperor and the minister
became more dependent the one upon the
other. Their plans grew more intricate and complicated.
They became as necessary to each other
as the two syllables are to form the words <i>e-vil</i>,
<i>en-vy</i>, and <i>mur-der</i>.</p>

<p>Although these men belonged to the same
vicious class, yet they were different in kind.
Tiberius could be rash; Sejanus must be cautious.
Of noble descent, Tiberius was base and mean;
of low origin, Sejanus assumed an air of nobility.
The one was slow, rough, and plain; the other,
quick, smooth, and pompous. When they were
together, Tiberius seemed inferior. There was
more vigor in the wickedness of Sejanus. He
was more elegant, more precise, and more ornate
in the forming and working out of his plans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Tiberius was uncouth, diffuse, and ordinary. In
their infernal deeds Tiberius was barbarous;
Sejanus, artistic. If they had been sculptors,
Tiberius would have carved a brutal and screaming
Fury; Sejanus, a sly and deriding Satyr.</p>

<p>Such were the similarities and the differences
between these two men who controlled the destinies
of the nation. What was the effect of their
personalities on the empire and the Roman
people? Only at Rome and in Italy were sowed
the seeds of violence. The other portions of the
empire tranquilly lived under the old laws of the
Divine Augustus. At Rome the Senate was
deceived into believing that the emperor was no
more than a figure-head.</p>

<p>The Curia was apparently respected. All freedom
and forms of the old Roman republic seemed
to be in force. But underneath this seeming tranquillity
sinister ideas were working. The Praetorian
soldiers were brought together in one
building within the city. Intimidation fell upon
the people. Interference with the courts took
place. But the most iniquitous system of espionage
was promulgated. No house of an important
citizen was secure from spies. Traitors lurked in
the bosoms of families. Money was freely paid
for information. As everything malignant was
believed, false testimony multiplied. The courts
were filled with trials for treason. The city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
became a festering mass of sneaking spies, unscrupulous
informers, and infamous liars.</p>

<p>Sejanus had already greeted the emperor in the
room adjoining the council chamber. With an
air of satisfaction Tiberius had replied that the
minister was gladly welcome.</p>

<p>“Why has the audience been dismissed so
hastily, O Tiberius?” asked Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Sit thou down. I will tell thee,” drawled the
emperor, as he slowly paced up and down the
room. He added: “Life at Rome is unbearable.
I long to leave the city and live where I can be
free.”</p>

<p>“But is not an emperor free, O noble man?”
asked the cunning minister.</p>

<p>“Free!” exclaimed the emperor, in a tone of
mockery. “The name of emperor is high-sounding;
but a hollow ball will make more noise than
a solid one. Ah, Sejanus, the criticisms that are
made and the satire that circulates against me, the
discontent of my relatives, and the unrest of the
people in Rome, all affect me, so that I am deprived
of all rest. My palace has become the
abode of lamentations. The air murmurs complaints.
The footsteps on the marble floors echo
sighs. The curtains between the rooms, like funeral
robes, drop from their folds oppressive
rustlings. My bed groans. My crumpling pillow
burns my head like a feverish hand. Free? Is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the emperor free? Ah, I must live away from
those who know me!”</p>

<p>“Thou art all-powerful, O Tiberius. Who
dares prevent thee from the full indulgence of thy
will?”</p>

<p>“’Tis not that which troubles me, O faithful
Sejanus. Where can I behold the face of one who
loves me? My mother hates me. Drusus hates
me. The she-wolf, Agrippina, and her whelps
also hate me. There is not one who trusts me,
not one who looks upon me with love. But I care
not! Ha, ha! I care not!”</p>

<p>There was no mirth in these ejaculations; they
were full of bitter irony.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O good Tiberius, why hast thou
become so embittered?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sejanus, my mother has but shortly left
me. Her words were burdened with hateful censure.
For years has she cherished letters written
to her by the Divine Augustus. To-day, in rage,
she gave them me. Here on the floor are the
words of invective he wrote her about me. He
calls me ‘a thorn in his flesh,’ ‘a canker feeding
on his happiness’—ye gods! and I, like a
whipped boy, heard the abuse without raising a
hand! My mother never loved me. Nay, all the
gradations of the word <i>hate</i> express the regard
she has always had for me. To-day she parted
from me forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Thy mother is aged and—”</p>

<p>“Ay, aged,” interposed Tiberius; “but her
mind is clear. Then Drusus hates me because
I trust thee.”</p>

<p>“Full well do I know his hatred,” assented
Sejanus.</p>

<p>“But—what didst thou say, O honest friend?”
asked Tiberius, not grasping the full meaning of
Sejanus.</p>

<p>“At last I understand thy son’s hatred,” repeated
Sejanus.</p>

<p>“What dost thou mean?”</p>

<p>“When thou hast finished, I will tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Let not passion warp thy true regard for my
son,” said the emperor, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Proceed, O noble Tiberius,” begged Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Agrippina and her two sons—Nero and
Drusus—hate me because of the death of Germanicus
and because they do not receive more
power. Ah! they all hate me. I hate them. I
hate the Senators with their soft words and flattering
servility. I hate the city, I hate the people.
Bah!”</p>

<p>The tone of Tiberius and the vehemence with
which he ended his bitter words of hatred affected
Sejanus like water on thirsty lips. Every such
storm of abuse gave him a nearer approach to
the quaffing of the cup of full power. In all
his castle building he had never dreamed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
possibility of the emperor’s living outside of
Rome.</p>

<p>“Thou hast true cause for hatred, O abused
man,” said Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Ay! But I know well this game of hate.
Woe to those that hate me and those that I hate!
The people shall be taught that Tiberius never
forgives or forgets. I will go to an island—Dost
thou remember Capri, with its inaccessible
cliffs? Ay, I will go there. From Capri the
blows shall fall. Then can I cry with untrammelled
joy, ‘I am free! I am free!’”</p>

<p>As he uttered these last words, he gathered in
his right hand a part of his toga which had become
loosened, and threw it over his left shoulder.
This action caused the plaster on his face
to loosen. A little watery stream colored with
blood trickled down his cheek and dropped upon
his toga. Tiberius pressed the plaster with his
hand, which, becoming moist with the suppuration,
he wiped on his greasy hair.</p>

<p>“Right well do I remember, O Tiberius, the
cliffs of Capri,” said Sejanus. “There thou shalt
be truly free. Ay, and respect for a ruler increases
when his power is felt and he is not seen.
But thou hast friends in Rome, O Tiberius,—friends
who would die for thee.”</p>

<p>“Ay, thou art the only man who dost understand
my wishes. I love and trust thee. I confide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
in thee as I confide in no other man. But
what knowest thou about Drusus, O truthful
friend?”</p>

<p>“Goest thou to his dinner this night?” inquired
Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Ay; and thou?” asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“Business in the camp prevents me.”</p>

<p>“Always on duty, O faithful Sejanus! Would
that others were as attentive as thou art!”</p>

<p>“I shall appear later,” he said. He paused a
moment, and then continued, “But how can I inform
thee of thy danger?”</p>

<p>“By Hercules! To what danger dost thou
refer?”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst not believe me if I should tell
thee,” replied Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Have I ever doubted thy word?”</p>

<p>“Nay, O Tiberius; but this is incredible.”</p>

<p>“Incredible, sayest thou? But hast thou
proofs?”</p>

<p>“Ay, convincing and undeniable proofs.”</p>

<p>“Then be silent no longer.”</p>

<p>“Give me thine ear, O Tiberius,” he said
dramatically. “<i>There is a plot against thy life!</i>”</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h! By the gods! Some one wishes
me dead? Continue, O Sejanus!”</p>

<p>“Ay; but there is no danger. I have worked
with my spies and know all the details,” said the
minister, assuringly. “This night, whilst thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
drinkest with Drusus, an attempt will be made to
poison thee.”</p>

<p>“Drusus will try to poison me?”</p>

<p>“Said I not that it was incredible?”</p>

<p>“Surely thou art wrong!” shouted the emperor.
“His mind is too weak to plot. He indulges
too much in the pleasures of life to wish
to rule.”</p>

<p>“What I have said, O Tiberius, is true. At
the end of the dinner he will approach thee with
a cup of wine. Drink not the first cup. Heed
my words; for of a truth I know of what I
speak.”</p>

<p>“Who has told thee this?”</p>

<p>“An honest spy, who never loses sight of thy
son,” replied Sejanus. “Drusus bought some
poison. He also purchased a golden cup. In
that cup death will lurk. Touch it not!”</p>

<p>“Have I not said he hates me? Yet never did
I believe that he would go so far,” said Tiberius,
fearfully impressed by the announcement of the
minister.</p>

<p>“Was he at the audience?” asked Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Ay,” replied the emperor. “Well do I remember
the anxiety he expressed to have me present
at the dinner this night. By Jupiter! I will
remain at home.”</p>

<p>“Remain at home if it be thy pleasure,” said
the minister; “but in remaining at home thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
losest the opportunity for proof. Continually
wilt thou be liable to danger from him. Go, O
noble Tiberius! Watch carefully, eat fearlessly,
but drink ever cautiously.”</p>

<p>Tiberius paused a short time, and then with
an air of determination said: “I will go. But fail
not to meet me before the evening is over.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHAT mellow wine is sold here, O Sulpicius!”
said a young Roman named
Sabinus.</p>

<p>“Ay, near the Grape God’s Temple good wine
only must be sold, O Sabinus,” replied Sulpicius.</p>

<p>The speakers were free and careless young
Romans. Under no restraint, they spent their
lives in pleasure. They were seated at a table
opposite each other, in a vine-covered bower
which occupied a corner of a summer garden not
far from the Via Appia. At the right the garden
extended to a Temple of Bacchus. Farther to
the right, at the foot of a small hill, was a Grotto
of Egeria.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Back of the garden was the Sacred
Forest,<a id="FNanchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> where the old Roman king Numa held
interviews with the nymph Egeria.</p>

<p>Seated beside Sabinus was a dancing-girl
named Merope; beside Sulpicius was another,
named Elea. Merope was fair; her face was
pretty, with ravishing lips, soft, rosy cheeks, and
pure blue eyes like miraculous flowers. Elea was
equally beautiful, but her beauty was of a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
type. She was dark, with a soft olive complexion,
voluptuous lips, and eyes that appeared
to have gathered into their depths the light of a
summer evening. Their necks and arms were
bare except where shoulder-straps held loosely
the fronts and backs of their tunicae. They were
happy maidens. Their smiles seemed perpetual.
Every word they spoke carried with it a ring of
pleasure.</p>

<p>A boy, with large, black, inquisitive eyes, a
handsome young face, short hair, with bare arms
and legs, stood before the group, awaiting an
order. A thin man, poorly dressed, with musical
reeds in his hand, sat on the ground, and reclined
against a stone building where wine was stored in
large amphorae.</p>

<p>“Ho, boy! Our lips are still thirsty. Bring us
more wine,” ordered Sabinus, drawing Merope’s
hand into his.</p>

<p>The boy quickly obeyed, playfully kicking the
feet of the poor musician as he went into the stone
building.</p>

<p>Elea caressed the cheek of Sulpicius with her
delicate hand, and, bending gracefully over and
looking into his eyes, said, “How happy is life!”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Elea, life is happy in the sunny days
of youth and plenty. Yonder is a poor son of
Pan. Ho, pipe-blower, come hither! Knowest
thou a joyful air?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Expect not sweet music from a sour face,
O Sulpicius,” said Sabinus.</p>

<p>“Homely flowers give the sweetest honey,”
said the reed-player, who had risen and presented
himself before the happy group.</p>

<p>“Ah, a poet! What dost thou call thyself,
O son of Pan?” asked Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“I am sometimes called Narcissus.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! and why, forsooth?”</p>

<p>“My words bloom and die like flowers.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but that is true of all words.”</p>

<p>“Nay, O Sunny Life. Beautiful and fragile
are the words of Narcissus.”</p>

<p>“And yellow?”</p>

<p>“The sun is golden,” he replied, lightly playing
upon the word.</p>

<p>“Then, thou flowery poet, give us a song.
Well shalt thou be paid if thou dost please us.”</p>

<p>“Hold, I pray thee, O Sulpicius!” interrupted
Sabinus, as he turned to a little flower-girl who
just then entered the garden. “Come hither,
little maid, and give us thy flowers. How fresh
they are!”</p>

<p>“They were gathered and watered in the early
morn. Not until the sun began to descend were
they placed in my basket,” replied the little girl.</p>

<p>“We will buy them all, frail little flower. What
is thy name?”</p>

<p>“Rosilla,” replied the child, bashfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Take thy basket. Here is a coin. Art thou
content, O Rosilla?” asked Sabinus.</p>

<p>The child, surprised and contented, bashfully
withdrew without making any reply.</p>

<p>“What pretty things flowers are!” added Sabinus.
“Here are blue iris and violets for thee,
O Merope. And for thee, O Elea, are gorgeous
roses. Here is one like a kissing mouth. Ah,
Merope, with these violets in thy fair hair thou
art a Flora.”</p>

<p>“If thy Merope is a Flora, my Elea is the
Greek Chloris,” added Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Dost thou mean the Greek goddess of flowers
or the daughter of Niobe, O Sulpicius?” asked
Elea.</p>

<p>“Whichever is the prettier, my fragrant flower.
But why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Verily, I am Chloris, Niobe’s daughter, in
the dance to be given at Pompey’s Theatre.”</p>

<p>“Who is the Niobe in the dance?”</p>

<p>“The Greek, Psyche. Hast thou seen her?”</p>

<p>“Ay, a beautiful girl.”</p>

<p>“A wonderful dancer,” added Merope.</p>

<p>“She dances not, O Merope. So light is she
that she seems to float in the air,” said Elea.</p>

<p>“Is she not young for a Niobe?” asked
Sabinus.</p>

<p>“Ay, her face is like that of a celestial Hora;
but she carries years in the dignity of her pose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“’Tis her last dance.”</p>

<p>“Meanest thou that she leaves Rome?”</p>

<p>“Nay, she becomes the bride of Gyges.”</p>

<p>“The young charioteer?” asked Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Ay, and a handsome man,” replied Elea.</p>

<p>“Dost thou dance also with her, O Merope?”
asked Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Ay, I am Lydia. I die soon in the dance.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou die also, O Elea?” asked Sabinus,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Nay, Chloris was the only daughter of Niobe
that was saved,” replied Elea.</p>

<p>“But look ye, Narcissus droops under the
weight of his poetic mind,” said Sulpicius.
“Come! A cup of wine, Narcissus. Words flow
more freely from lips wet by the juice of the
grape.”</p>

<p>Narcissus eagerly swallowed his wine. He
then blew on his reeds plaintive notes like those
with which shepherds collect their flocks. The
garden was wrapped in silence. The clear air
was motionless. The sun was near the western
hills, and the light that fell on the happy revellers
was such as filters through soft olive-trees. The
piping of the reeds seemed to produce a pastoral
environment. Narcissus sang: “On the side of
Ida’s classic mount a shepherd tends his flock.
With graceful form, quick in motion, eyes bright
as stars, face like Apollo’s! O happy shepherd!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Again Narcissus played the shepherds’ call.
Suddenly he altered the theme, giving more
melody to his song and making it a softer and
gentler phrase than the shepherds’ air. He sang:
“By the bank of a crystal brook near by, a
maiden sang a song. With eyes of blue like bits
of sky, with face as fresh as lovely dawn, O
happy maid!”</p>

<p>With clever art Narcissus now played a new
tune, ingeniously combining the themes of both
the preceding airs. He sang: “No words float
on the crystal air, but words are heard by both.
The shepherd gazes towards the brook, the maiden
towards the pure white flock. O happy flying
thoughts!”</p>

<p>Now the reed-player softly breathed upon the
pipes, which whispered a motive of joy. Then
he sang these words: “The shepherd leaves his
peaceful flock, the maiden the transparent brook.
On their pure lips no words come forth, the time
is used for kisses only. O happy shepherd! O
happy maid!”</p>

<p>With a flourish of notes Narcissus finished the
picture.</p>

<p>Elea, who was seated near Sulpicius, with her
face partially buried in the roses, listened to this
modest song of love. Sulpicius threw his arm
around her and drew her near him. Slightly
pressing the flowers so that they partially hid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
her pretty face, he kissed her lips between the
roses. Neither could Sabinus resist the tempting
lips of Merope.</p>

<p>Narcissus, feeling solitary, inquired, “Will my
fingers be kissed with money, O happy youths?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Sulpicius, smiling. “Dost thou
prefer a copper kiss or one of silver?”</p>

<p>“One of silver would be more gentle. ’Tis
many a day since I have known that touch.”</p>

<p>“So be it. Here is thy reward.”</p>

<p>Narcissus played a new air and then sang:
“Drink life, O happy souls! as the flowers drink
of dew. Drink of the waters that carry odors
of deep woods. Be as cheerful as the daisy,
whose glorious centre is bordered by pure white
foliage. Be as gentle as the little myosotis, in
whose blossoms hides the color of heaven. Be
like the pure lily, perfumed snow, O happy souls!
Let thy thoughts be like the brook flowing among
lotus and iris, ferns and waterlilies, kissing the
shadowy bank of forgetfulness, O happy youths!
Be—”</p>

<p>“Hold!” cried Sulpicius. “We have been well
entertained for our money. Now leave us. Look
ye! Psyche and Gyges enter.”</p>

<p>At the sight of friends Psyche and Gyges, who
had been depressed when they entered the garden,
grew more cheerful.</p>

<p>“Hail, Sulpicius and Sabinus! Hail to thee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Merope, and thee, Elea!” said Gyges. “Whence
these fair flowers?”</p>

<p>“The violets are the eyes of Merope,” said
Sabinus.</p>

<p>“The roses are the lips of Elea,” added
Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Our minds have been fed on the words of
a poet, O Psyche,” said Merope, laughing.</p>

<p>“’Tis sweet food for the mind, O Merope.
What a beautiful evening draws near!” said
Psyche.</p>

<p>“Ay; the sky is cloudless,” replied Merope.</p>

<p>“How clear are yonder Alban Mountains!”
said Gyges.</p>

<p>“Ay; like a crown, with the villas sparkling
among the trees like jewels,” said Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Sit ye down and drink a cup of wine,” invited
Sabinus.</p>

<p>“We dare not tarry long, O friends,” said
Gyges, as he and Psyche seated themselves.
“But,” he added, “a cup of wine will refresh
us.”</p>

<p>Laughing and talking with their happy friends,
the depression of Psyche and Gyges soon vanished.
After they had drunk the wine they rose
to depart.</p>

<p>“What a handsome chain, O Psyche!” said
Elea.</p>

<p>“’Tis a gift of Gyges,” said Psyche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Truly, ’tis a perfect gift!” exclaimed
Merope.</p>

<p>“Can ye not stay and eat with us?” asked
Sulpicius.</p>

<p>“Nay, we must away. Fare ye well, O happy
friends! May smiles be always on thy lips!”
said Gyges, as he and Psyche went on their
way.</p>

<p>“Are they not lovely maidens, O Gyges?”
asked Psyche, when they were out upon the Via
Appia, walking towards home.</p>

<p>“Ay, my Psyche,” he assented.</p>

<p>“They dance well too,” she added.</p>

<p>“Elea dances the better,” said Gyges. “She
makes a good Chloris to thy Niobe.”</p>

<p>“Are we not late? See, the sun has set long
since! Wilt thou not dine with us this night,
O Gyges?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ay; ’tis Gannon’s night at home,” he replied.</p>

<p>“What new story will he have to tell us, I
wonder?” she asked. “He always brings cheer
when he comes home. Last week he told us of
Livilla.”</p>

<p>“Ay, he is truly a happy youth.”</p>

<p>“His large eyes will open wider when he sees
his sister’s new home,” said Psyche.</p>

<p>Their conversation was still running on Gannon
when they turned down the street that led
to Alcmaeon’s home. Noticing the soldiers stationed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
before the house, the lovers quickened
their steps. When they arrived at the door,
Gyges asked one of the soldiers, “What dost
thou wish?”</p>

<p>“Alcmaeon and his family are under arrest,”
replied the soldier. “He and his wife have gone
to the camp. We await the daughter.”</p>

<p>At this announcement Psyche excitedly inquired:
“What have they done? I am their
daughter.”</p>

<p>“I know not. Long enough have we waited
for thee,” said the soldier, angrily. “Come, thou
must go at once!”</p>

<p>“But give me leave to go to my room,” said
Psyche, trembling, as she opened the door.</p>

<p>While she was gone, Gyges asked for more
information. He learned that Gannon had fallen
and was dead, and that the lad’s body had been
sent to be cremated. With a heavy heart he
entered the house and called Psyche. She ran to
him; and reading in his face that something
horrible had occurred, she cried, “O Gyges, what
has happened?”</p>

<p>“O my love, the little dead fish was a true
omen.”</p>

<p>“But no one is dead?” asked Psyche, excitedly.</p>

<p>He drew her towards him as he said: “Be
brave, O love! A great calamity has befallen
thee and thy parents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Tell me the truth, O Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Gannon is dead,” he quietly whispered.</p>

<p>Psyche, overwhelmed with grief, buried her
face on her lover’s shoulder. Through her sobs
she asked, “How did he die?”</p>

<p>“He fell from the roof of the camp.”</p>

<p>“May I not see him?” she asked.</p>

<p>“’Tis best thou shouldst not,” replied her
lover.</p>

<p>“But what means the arrest, O Gyges?”</p>

<p>“I know not, O love,—but we must go.
Soldiers have no hearts. Be brave, my Psyche!
Pray to the gods for strength.”</p>

<p>“But there,” he suddenly exclaimed, “is a
tunic!”</p>

<p>Hastily taking up the garment from which
Hera had begun to remove the cloth that held
Gannon’s message, Gyges gave the tunic to
Psyche, saying, “’Tis Gannon’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis poor comfort to see only his tunic,”
she said, as she kissed it. “But look!” she
quickly added, “here is some writing! Come
to the light and read the words.” When they
reached the small courtyard, she read: “Have
done wrong. Read a letter from L to S about
Lygdus.”</p>

<p>“Come, you must go!” roughly commanded
the soldier, opening the door.</p>

<p>Gyges received permission to accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Psyche, and the sorrowful lovers left the house.
The walk to the camp was a painfully sad one.
They both recalled their happy afternoon in their
future home. Fresh tears gushed from Psyche’s
eyes when they passed the street on which the
house stood. As they went along, Gyges, who
had been trying to unravel the mystery of Gannon’s
message, suddenly whispered to Psyche,
“Oh that we had not seen that writing!”</p>

<p>“Why, what harm can those words do? They
were the last we shall ever hear from him,” whispered
Psyche through her sobs.</p>

<p>“Nay, my love; I fear they are dangerous.”
Then he added apprehensively, “I know Lygdus.”</p>

<p>“But I do not understand thee.”</p>

<p>“Speak not so loud, O Psyche, the soldiers
may hear us. Thy dear brother wrote, ‘Have
done wrong.’ I fear he had learned some terrible
secret, and that we, in reading these words,
have gained a clue to that secret. Oh that we
had not seen that writing!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“There can be no harm in knowing about
Lygdus.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my love, there is harm,” he insisted.
“Never acknowledge having read that message.
If thou art asked about it in the camp, deny all
knowledge concerning it. Promise me this, O
my love.”</p>

<p>“I promise thee, O my Gyges.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>At the Praetorian Camp Gyges repeated this
warning, and then the lovers parted. Feeling
assured that she would see Gyges the next day,
Psyche said farewell with no great misgivings.
Oppressed with anguish at the terrible death of
Gannon, but as yet unconscious of the approach
of new misfortune, she was led into the office
of Sejanus. The minister had just returned from
his visit to the palace on the Palatine Hill. A dim
light revealed him seated on a curule chair surrounded
by a few soldiers, to whom he was issuing
orders. When Psyche was announced, he dismissed
his attendants. When they were left alone,
he said, “Truly, art thou the dancing-girl?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord Sejanus,” said Psyche, in a plaintive
tone.</p>

<p>“Art thou Gannon’s sister?”</p>

<p>“Ay; and—”</p>

<p>“Thou wast not at home when thy parents
were brought here?” Sejanus roughly interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Where wert thou?”</p>

<p>“With Gyges, walking upon the Via Appia.”</p>

<p>“Who is Gyges?”</p>

<p>“A charioteer—”</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember. He wears the green color.
I know him. Is he a relative?”</p>

<p>“He is my lover,” she shyly responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“True. All dancing-girls have their lovers,”
he sneered. “But didst thou return home?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” answered Psyche, drawing herself up
with dignity.</p>

<p>“Whom didst thou see at home?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“There was a tunic there. Didst thou see it?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst have it in thy hands?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst read a message from Gannon
sewed upon it?”</p>

<p>“Nay, O Sejanus,” calmly replied the unfortunate
maid.</p>

<p>“I say thou didst read it.”</p>

<p>“I repeat I did not read it.”</p>

<p>“Was Gyges with thee when thou didst have
the tunic?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord.”</p>

<p>Sejanus called a soldier, who promptly appeared.</p>

<p>“Search immediately for Gyges the charioteer!
Arrest him!”</p>

<p>“What have I said that makes thee arrest
him?” asked Psyche, in a tone of fear.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What have I done, O Sejanus, that I should
be here? Where are my parents?” she plaintively
pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Thy brother read a letter,” replied Sejanus.
“He sewed into his tunic a message about that
letter. Thy parents read the message. Thou
didst hold the tunic in thy hands, thou sayest, and
therefore thou also must have read the message.”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis not true, O Sejanus. I saw no
message.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe thee. Thy brother lied to
me. Thy parents lied to me. Now the sister
lies to me.”</p>

<p>“I lie not, O Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“We sometimes press the thumbs until they
are flat, in order to learn the truth. ’Twould
be a pity to press thy pretty thumbs—”</p>

<p>“Oh! Sejanus,” she cried in terror, “thou wilt
not torture me?”</p>

<p>“Ay. A soldier will do anything to learn the
truth,” he cruelly replied.</p>

<p>“But I tell thee the truth.”</p>

<p>“And I believe thee not.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt not torture me!” she cried, now
thoroughly alarmed. “Nay, nay, nay, O Sejanus!
Where are my parents?”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt never see them again.”</p>

<p>“Never see them again!” screamed Psyche.
“Are they dead too?”</p>

<p>“Nay; calm thyself. They are in prison.
Now tell me, didst thou read the message?”</p>

<p>“I have already answered thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Then prepare for torture.”</p>

<p>“O Gyges, Gyges!” cried Psyche. “Would
that thou wert here to help me!”</p>

<p>“No one can help thee,” said the implacable
tyrant.</p>

<p>“But have I not suffered enough?” she said,
breathing quickly and stamping nervously with
her foot on the marble floor. “Do not press my
thumbs! I have told thee the truth! I know
nothing! Ah!” she screamed suddenly, as a new
thought surged in her mind. “I understand.
Gannon did not fall. He was killed, ay, killed!”</p>

<p>“Come, O pretty maid; not so loud. Pray be
calm.”</p>

<p>“Ay, killed, for knowing what? My parents
are in prison for the same cause—what? And
I am to be tortured to confess—what?”</p>

<p>“Time will show,” said Sejanus, grimly, as
he noticed the hysterical condition of Psyche.
He called a soldier and said: “Place this prisoner
in a private cell. Go!”</p>

<p>“May I not see my parents?” cried Psyche,
beseechingly.</p>

<p>“No,” he abruptly replied. As she left the
office, moaning and crying, he said to himself,
“A very fair maiden, and perchance—” A smile
passed over his evil face as he thought of Psyche
alone and in his power.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the soldier who had been despatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
for Gannon’s tunic returned and handed
it to his master. After reading Gannon’s writing,
Sejanus craftily said, “Art thou content with
thy position?”</p>

<p>“Ay, O noble lord,” replied the soldier.</p>

<p>“Thou canst be advanced. Write me a sentence
in Greek.”</p>

<p>“I know not Greek, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Surely thou knowest the letters. Write a
few of them.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I know the letters, O Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“For knowing how to write one sentence I
would promote thee.”</p>

<p>“Truly, O master, I know nothing of the
language.”</p>

<p>“Where wert thou born?”</p>

<p>“At the Etruscan town of Nepete.”</p>

<p>“When didst thou leave thy native town?”</p>

<p>“Two years since.”</p>

<p>“How long hast thou been a soldier in the
camp?”</p>

<p>“Two years, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Thou art dismissed,” commanded Sejanus,
satisfied with the soldier’s answers.</p>

<p>Tearing the message from Gannon’s tunic,
Sejanus exultantly burned in a lamp all traces
of the lad’s knowledge concerning Lygdus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the palace of Drusus the important dinner,
whose outcome so many anxiously waited,
had been prepared, but the emperor had not arrived.
He was impatiently awaited in the atrium
by Drusus and Livilla. Julia, their daughter, was
with them. Near by the guests were laughing
and talking. Livilla’s mother and brother, Antonia
and Claudius, were there. Among the
other relatives were Agrippina and her daughters,
Agrippina, Drusilla, and Julia; and her
sons, Nero, Drusus, and Caligula. Outside of
the family only the consul and a few Senators
with their wives were present. Livilla
appeared excited and talked hurriedly. She
asked Drusus, “Art thou sure the emperor will
come?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Livilla; I am positive that he will be
here,” replied Drusus, assuringly.</p>

<p>“’Tis late. I wonder what hinders him,” she
nervously asked.</p>

<p>“Be not so excited, O Livilla,” replied her
husband. “Why dost thou tremble? What dost
thou fear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“I fear nothing,” she answered, forcing an
air of composure.</p>

<p>“Then be calm, I pray thee. Didst thou ever
see thy mother so ill at ease, O daughter Julia?”</p>

<p>“Her hands are cold,” said Julia. “Art thou
ill, O mother?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my daughter,” replied the mother, trying
to smile.</p>

<p>A burst of laughter interrupted them. Claudius,
who was the centre of a small group, was
receiving humorous attacks made upon him by
Nero.</p>

<p>“Of a truth, Livilla,” said Drusus, “thy
brother grows stouter every day. His life can
be summed up in three words,—eat, drink, and
sleep. Go, Julia, join thy cousins and be happy.”</p>

<p>“But why tarries the emperor?” again impatiently
asked Livilla.</p>

<p>“Mayhap Sejanus detains him,” said Drusus.
“New honors, O Livilla, have been awarded the
minister, while I receive nothing. Insulted in
the Senate has our grandmother, Livia, been this
day by our father. Insulted also have I been by
him. The Senate decreed me honors which my
father would not allow. O Livilla, Sejanus, my
enemy, is loved by my father, whilst I, the heir,
am hated. Verily do I believe that my death
would be welcomed by them both!”</p>

<p>Livilla made no reply. She played with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
rings on her fingers as she gazed vacantly before
her. She started when Drusus added, “Is
not that true?”</p>

<p>“What didst thou say, O Drusus?”</p>

<p>“Ah! thy thoughts drift far away, O Livilla.
What troubles thee? Thou dreamest with thine
eyes open.”</p>

<p>“I dream of the future, my lord.”</p>

<p>“But our future can be more happy than the
present. Truly, I have been tormented by the
man I hate. I am rough, but I love my family.
Let us quarrel no more, O wife. Why dost thou
tremble?”</p>

<p>“I know not, my lord. I feel a sinking in my
heart. A cup of wine will strengthen me.”</p>

<p>A slave brought a cup of wine, which she
hastily drank. With an effort she controlled
herself and forced a smile. She and Drusus
then joined Antonia, who was talking to her
daughter-in-law, Agrippina. Caligula, the thin
and pale twelve-year-old son of Agrippina, stood
with his arm locked in his mother’s.</p>

<p>“Thou art sad, O mother,” said Livilla to
Antonia.</p>

<p>“Ay; we were speaking of thy brother, Germanicus,”
replied Antonia.</p>

<p>“Truly, ’twas this very day, six years ago,
that his ashes were laid in the mausoleum of the
Divine Augustus. I had forgotten,” said Livilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“But the lad, Caligula, bears on his face the
stamp of thy noble husband, O Agrippina,” said
Drusus.</p>

<p>“Nero resembles his father more than Caligula
does, O Drusus,” objected Antonia.</p>

<p>“The eyes of a grandmother are rarely deceived,”
said Agrippina, looking with pride upon
her son Nero, who stood not far from her.</p>

<p>“Then whom do I resemble?” asked Caligula,
playing with his mother’s hand.</p>

<p>“Thou lookest more like thy mother, O child,”
said his grandmother, Antonia.</p>

<p>“My masters say that I resemble the bust of
my divine ancestor when he was a lad,” said
Caligula, bashfully.</p>

<p>The arrival of the emperor checked all further
conversation. Silence fell upon the crowd. With
his face stolid and severe, Tiberius nodded to the
guests, who replied with murmured words of
salutation. At the sight of the emperor Livilla
appeared more at ease. She kissed him upon the
forehead, and after the dinner had been announced
she walked with him into the triclinium.</p>

<p>The sumptuous dining-room, whose marble
walls had echoed with the poetic words of
Horace, Virgil, and Propertius, was brightly
lighted by curiously wrought silver lamps, resting
on graceful onyx columns. Grouped around
a table in a semicircle and covered with cushions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of variegated colored silks, were the couches on
which the guests reclined. As the different
courses were served, Drusus endeavored to enliven
the conversation, but the voices which at
the appearance of Tiberius had become hushed
were still restrained. Tiberius conversed chiefly
with Antonia. When he sometimes addressed
others, he snapped his words like a snarling dog.
In spite of the efforts of Drusus to be entertaining,
no one was at ease. Agrippina conversed
in an undertone. Her children forced an air of
gayety. Livilla nervously regarded her husband.
The Senators spoke only when they were
addressed.</p>

<p>“Hast thou no hunger, O father Tiberius?”
asked Drusus, when the emperor had refused
three courses in succession.</p>

<p>“My appetite has lately left me,” answered
Tiberius, closely regarding his son.</p>

<p>Drusus lowered his gaze as he said, “Thou
wilt not refuse a cup of wine?”</p>

<p>Again Tiberius glanced critically at Drusus.
“Offer me no wine at present, O Drusus,” he
replied.</p>

<p>Still addressing his father, Drusus said,
“’Twas with great regret I learned that our
grandmother Livia could not attend our dinner.”</p>

<p>To these words, which were received as an insult,
Tiberius sarcastically replied, “With equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
regret I heard that it would be impossible for
Sejanus to attend.”</p>

<p>Drusus had meant no insolence, but the words
of his father were a direct affront. Curbing his
anger, but speaking in a loud tone, he said,
“Henceforth, O father, refrain from speaking
that name before me.”</p>

<p>At the loud, harsh tones of Drusus the guests
became even more constrained. With a deeper
frown on his forehead and a sneer on his lips,
Tiberius said: “Thou knowest not the man thou
abusest. No one in Rome sacrifices personal
pleasures for public duties more than he does.
Affairs of state occupy all his time. His unselfish
nature is one that all should imitate. Vilify
the sluggard who revels continually. Revile not
the just. Sejanus is my friend, and nothing shall
be spoken before <i>me</i> that tends to dishonor him.”</p>

<p>Hearing his father thus championing the cause
of Sejanus, Drusus, although chagrined, assumed
a respectful demeanor, and rising from his couch
and approaching his father, said: “Then let discord
go her way, O father Tiberius! The impetuosity
of anger often produces burning words.
We will drink a toast to peace. Let bitterness be
washed away by the crimson wine! What, ho!
a toast!”</p>

<p>At this command Lygdus entered, bearing on
a silver tray several cups of silver and one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
gold. A slave bore a large urn filled with wine.
Drusus took the vessel and filled the golden cup
and one of silver.</p>

<p>Lygdus passed the cups to the emperor, who
took the one of silver.</p>

<p>Drusus, seeing the golden cup left for him,
said, “This cup is for thee, O father!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my son,” said Tiberius, with his eyes
riveted on Drusus.</p>

<p>“But I insist, O father!”</p>

<p>“Golden words of peace should be bathed with
wine from a golden cup,” said Tiberius, with an
effort at calmness. “But come,” he added, “a
toast to peace and the absent Sejanus!”</p>

<p>Livilla anxiously watched every motion of
Tiberius, Drusus, and Lygdus. She nervously
clutched a pillow from the couch, and unconsciously
compressed it with such violence that
she felt the firm pressure of her fingers on the
palm of her hand. In her excitement she drew
her cheek between her teeth, and bit it so hard
that it bled.</p>

<p>At first, when the wine was offered him, Tiberius
started. Every detail was being enacted as
Sejanus had predicted. The emperor watched
his son’s expression, and marvelled at the indifferent
air with which Drusus insisted upon offering
him the golden cup. He marvelled still more
when Drusus, with no show of fear, took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
golden cup in his own hands. Tiberius thought
the dissimulation of Drusus was most cleverly
done.</p>

<p>But Drusus was innocent of the terrible crime
which his father attributed to him. He did not
dream that an infamous plot was being ingeniously
carried out. He lightly raised the golden
cup, and at the toast to peace he readily nodded
assent. But when Tiberius added to the toast the
name of Sejanus, Drusus recoiled and trembled.
If there were any doubts in the mind of Tiberius
that Drusus wished to poison him, these doubts
vanished at the confusion with which Drusus appeared
to be seized. With visible emotion Drusus
took the cup, and in one swallow drank half the
contents.</p>

<p>The crafty eunuch watched minutely every
expression and action of Drusus and Tiberius.
Having been informed by Sejanus which cup
Tiberius would choose, the eunuch had put
poison into the golden cup. When Drusus
drank from that cup, the face of Lygdus remained
passive, but his snake-like eyes sparkled
with satisfaction.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_130fp.jpg" alt="He staggered and the cup dropped from his hand and bounded upon the floor"></div>

<p>After drinking the wine Drusus turned towards
his couch, carrying the golden cup in his hand.
He staggered before he reached it, and the cup
dropped from his hand and bounded upon the
floor. He recovered himself and finally reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>his couch. In a thick voice he called for water.
Before the water could be given him he became
unconscious. Writhing in the throes of agony,
he fell heavily upon the floor and expired.</p>

<p>At this horrible sight the guests were filled
with consternation and became almost panic-stricken.
They hastily departed, mingling expressions
of fear and condolence. Tiberius exulted
in the narrow escape he had had, and
looked upon the death of his son as a just visitation;
for now he believed completely the story
of Sejanus. Ordering the body to be carried to
the room of Drusus, and disdaining to proffer
words of consolation to Livilla and her weeping
daughter Julia, he departed. In a short time
the triclinium was deserted by all except the
servants, who moved about in awe-struck silence.
Not so with Lygdus, who smiled exultantly
as he removed every trace of the horrible
crime.</p>

<p>At the sight of the lifeless form of Drusus,
prone on the marble floor, Livilla felt a guilty
pang. She shed no tears, but a wild impulse
came upon her to hide herself. Antonia had remained
to comfort the stricken family. Julia
being hysterical, the grandmother remained with
her. When the palace had become quiet, and
no sound could be heard but the sobs of the
fatherless Julia, Sejanus triumphantly entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Lygdus met him, and together they went into
the chamber of Drusus. Sejanus smiled as he
contemptuously pushed the dead face of his innocent
victim.</p>

<p>“Was it soon over?” whispered Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Ay; ’twas a tame death. He called for
water, became unconscious, fell upon the floor,
and died,” answered the eunuch in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Were the guests frightened?”</p>

<p>“Verily; they waited not the emperor’s departure.”</p>

<p>“But I must hasten! Await me at the palace
entrance,” ordered Sejanus, as he went towards
Livilla’s room.</p>

<p>Livilla was anxiously awaiting his arrival.
Scarcely had the curtain covered the door when
she threw herself into his arms. Clasped in the
embrace of her infamous lover, she received
strength and assurance.</p>

<p>“’Tis over,” she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Ay, my heart’s love; now thou art free!”</p>

<p>“Softly, O Sejanus, my mother is near,” said
Livilla, drawing away.</p>

<p>“Did the emperor tremble?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nay; he appeared anxious only to leave,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“And Lygdus?”</p>

<p>“His face remained stolid during the most
critical moments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Ah! Said I not that he was trustworthy?
He shall be well paid for his performance.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my lover, I feel a heaviness in my breast,
and my head pains me.”</p>

<p>“’Tis but the excitement, Livilla. But I
must hasten to the Palatine Hill! Thou shalt
see me on the morrow. Fare thee well, my
love!”</p>

<p>“Happy omens be thy speed, O my lover,”
said Livilla, kissing him.</p>

<p>As he left, the noise of a crying child was
heard. It was one of the little twins, who,
awakening and feeling lonely, wished for a soothing
hand to caress him. Livilla hastened to the
little boy and patted him gently. He whispered,
“Father, father,” and fell peacefully asleep. She
stood there some time, oppressed and tormented
by her thoughts. Finally she buried her face in
the covers of his little bed and broke into smothered
sobs. So did her mother find her, and so
was her mother deceived into believing that those
tears were the tears of a loving and sorrowing
wife.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HAVING said farewell to Psyche, Gyges
stood in deep depression, watching her
retreating figure until she disappeared within
the grim walls of the camp. Clenching his
hands and shaking his head with a profound
sigh, he walked away. At first, not knowing
where to go, he wandered aimlessly. A confused
aggregation of thoughts surged through
his mind,—thoughts that were filled with horrible
forebodings. He could think of no plan
of action. As Gannon had been perplexed by
the words of Livilla, and as Alcmaeon and Hera
had been troubled by Gannon’s message, so
Gyges was now harassed by the same dreadful
doubts concerning Lygdus. The manner in
which Gannon had communicated with his family
made Gyges confident that the message was
written when Gannon was under grievous restraint.
The words “Have done wrong”
sounded in Gyges’ ears like the wail of a
crushed spirit. “The poor lad was in the depths
of despair when he wrote that,” thought Gyges.
“But how could he fall from the camp? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
did wrong, he was imprisoned—ye gods! Can
it be possible that he was murdered? Ay; no
one ever falls from the roof of the camp at midnight!
He was thrown! O Gannon!—poor,
poor lad! What was thy crime?”</p>

<p>“About Lygdus.” These words were the
most mysterious part of Gannon’s message; for
Gyges understood thoroughly the character of
the eunuch. It was Lygdus who had tried to
bribe him to lose a race. It was Lygdus who
had tried in the most dastardly manner to drug
him. It was the detestable Lygdus who had
dared to tamper with his horses. Moreover, the
eunuch had been accused of murder; but this
accusation, by some subtle means, had been prevented
from reaching the courts. He was a panderer
to the lust of Sejanus. He was a poor,
despicable degenerate, who revelled in all the
lowest forms of wickedness. “This is the
being,” said Gyges to himself, “who has somehow
caused Gannon’s death. To the house of
Lygdus I will go. Perchance something may
be learned there.”</p>

<p>Gyges now directed his steps to the house of
the eunuch. A servant answered his knock at
the door.</p>

<p>“Is thy master at home?”</p>

<p>“Nay, O stranger.”</p>

<p>“Where can he be found?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“I know not,” replied the servant, as if annoyed.</p>

<p>“When did he leave?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“When will he return?”</p>

<p>“I know not. Mayhap on the morrow.”</p>

<p>“But I must see him,” said Gyges, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Inquire at the Praetorian Camp,” suggested
the servant.</p>

<p>“I come from there,” said Gyges, as he feigned
an important air.</p>

<p>“And no one could tell thee?”</p>

<p>“No one,” Gyges replied; but immediately
added, “I am the bearer of important news.”</p>

<p>“Carry thy news to Sejanus. He can tell thee
the whereabouts of my master. I know nothing,”
said the servant, with increasing irritation.</p>

<p>“Then will I go to Sejanus,” said Gyges, as
he walked away.</p>

<p>“I have learned nothing there,” he said to
himself. “Truly, a servant of Lygdus would
not know whither his master would go. Sejanus
and his accomplices leave no traces. Ah! a
charioteer’s mind works slowly on a clue to
an infernal plot! But is this an infernal plot?
Gannon wrote: ‘Have done wrong. Read a
letter from L to S,’” A new idea suddenly
entered the mind of Gyges. “The letter was
from ‘L to S,’” he continued to reason. “Can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
it be that the ‘L’ is for Livilla? Psyche mentioned
that name as we were walking together.
Ay, I should have gone to the house of Drusus
with my inquiry. I will go there immediately.”</p>

<p>There came to his mind, as he walked towards
the Esquiline Hill, soothing recollections of the
day spent with Psyche. He remembered her
graceful dancing, the applause of the other
dancers, and the praise of the master. He recalled
her joyful exclamations as she passed the
shops on the Via Sacra. Psyche’s childish delight
at the sight of her new home came to him
like the memory of a sweet melody. Like the
iridescence of a sunbeam in a crystal dew-drop
was the remembrance of the blissful moments
spent with her amid the flowers of the peristyle.
Again he felt the same pang that he felt when
the dead fish checked the flow of the fountain.
“But the fountain played again,” he said to
himself. He recalled the walk into the Campagna,
the meeting of the happy friends, and the
walk to Psyche’s home. But suddenly the fearful
events that had succeeded broke these happy
recollections.</p>

<p>He remembered her surprise and fear at the
sight of the soldiers, her nervousness as she
requested a little time to go to her room, her
courage when she heard the terrible news of
Gannon’s death. He remembered how lovingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
she had kissed Gannon’s tunic, how tenderly she
had caressed the little scrap of cloth on which
Gannon had painfully inscribed his last sad words
to his family. He pictured her as she walked
to the barracks, sad but not crushed. His last
words to her were a caution against revealing
any knowledge of the writing on Gannon’s tunic.
She had replied, “I promise thee, O my Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Would that Gannon had not written that
message!” he said to himself. “Would that
we had not seen it! Ay, would also that Psyche
had gone directly home from the theatre! Then
she would have seen Gannon. Perchance she
would now be free.” But such wishes were
worse than useless. In one short day the happiness
of the family of Alcmaeon had been utterly
destroyed. Gannon had been killed; Alcmaeon,
Hera, and Psyche were prisoners. “Had Alcmaeon
and Hera seen that writing?” he questioned.
“What if Psyche should be tempted to
an admission? What if Sejanus and the brutes
in the camp should torture her and make her
confess? Would she, too, be killed? Perhaps
Alcmaeon and Hera were already murdered!”
He trembled as he groaned aloud, “It cannot be!
It cannot be!”</p>

<p>But Gyges, usually buoyant and hopeful, soon
subdued these despondent thoughts. He now
argued that Sejanus was justified in questioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Gannon’s family. He began to believe that after
a few days they would all be free. So occupied
had he been in contemplation that he now remembered
he had not dined; but notwithstanding
his hunger he proceeded on his way to the
Esquiline Hill.</p>

<p>When he arrived before the grated entrance to
the gardens of Drusus, he called to the gate-keeper,
“What ho!”</p>

<p>“What dost thou wish?” asked the gate-keeper,
carrying a lantern as he approached the
grating.</p>

<p>In the dim light Gyges saw some slaves and
litters outlined against the dark foliage of the
garden. “I come to inquire of one named
Lygdus,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I know of no guest by that name.”</p>

<p>“A guest?” asked Gyges, surprised.</p>

<p>“Ay; there is a dinner in the palace this
night,” replied the gate-keeper.</p>

<p>“But Lygdus would not be a guest,” said
Gyges.</p>

<p>“A servant arrived this morning to act as cup-bearer.
I know not his name,” replied the gate-keeper.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O gate-keeper, was he short and
stout, with a sleek face?”</p>

<p>“Ay; he talked in a—”</p>

<p>“The litter of Agrippina!” interrupted an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
excited voice from the palace. “The litter of
Drusilla!” cried another voice.</p>

<p>Hearing these orders, the gate-keeper abruptly
ended his conversation. Gyges retreated to a
wall opposite the iron grating. Other calls were
now heard. Then there was a confusion of slaves
as they marched up the path, carrying the litters
on their shoulders. Shortly after, flickering
through the trees, were seen lighted torches borne
by slaves preceding their masters. As the gate-keeper
swung open the gate, Gyges saw the excited
faces of Nero and Drusus. Following them,
Gyges recognized Claudius, who with heavy step
and panting breath tried to keep up with them.
One by one the litters were borne out. Finally
a cry, “The emperor! The emperor!” was heard,
and a gorgeous litter with drawn curtains and
surrounded by a guard of soldiers passed down
the path and through the entrance. Then there
was a silence, broken only by a few stragglers
who hastened to join those already departed. To
one of these stragglers Gyges said, “A pardon
for my boldness, but what has happened?”</p>

<p>“A dire calamity!”</p>

<p>“Some one is dead?”</p>

<p>“Ay; my lord Drusus.”</p>

<p>“The son of the emperor?” asked Gyges,
astounded.</p>

<p>“Ay; ’twas sudden! He died at dinner!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“May the gods be gracious to thee!” said
Gyges, as he withdrew.</p>

<p>The words of Gannon’s message again flashed
over his mind. They burned into his brain like
red-hot irons. Their full import now dawned
upon him. He now understood why Sejanus
wished to silence the boy’s lips. The terrible
possibilities of Psyche’s fate, if she but acknowledged
having read Gannon’s writing, tortured
him so that he knew not what to do. Finally
he decided to go to the house of Alcmaeon, procure
the tunic, and destroy the evidence. As he
left the palace gate, he heard the tramp of feet
on the lava-paved street. He concealed himself
in the shadow of the wall and waited. A litter
escorted by a few soldiers stopped near him. He
saw a man descend, and he heard an order to
wait at the entrance. He saw the gate swing
open. The faint light of the porter’s lantern
revealed the features of the minister and murderer,
Sejanus.</p>

<p>At the sight of the man who had caused
Gannon’s murder and Psyche’s imprisonment,
there rushed over Gyges such a flood of bitterness
and hatred that with supreme difficulty
he restrained an impulse to spring and strangle
him. But Sejanus quickly disappeared in the
darkness, and Gyges was again left alone with
his thoughts. This time he thought of himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Questions such as these arose in his mind:
“What if Sejanus knew that I was with Psyche
when she was arrested? What if he knew that
I had read Gannon’s message? What if he knew
that I have full insight into his infernal crime?”
Gyges trembled. The terrible significance of his
position almost overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>But his unhappy meditations were cut short by
the return of Sejanus. The minister was not
alone. Some one kissed his hand. The massive
gate was opened by the porter. As the gate
closed, a face from within looked through the
iron bars. Gyges started; for in the dim light
he recognized the leering features of Lygdus.</p>

<p>As soon as Sejanus and his guards had passed
on, Gyges, with trembling speed, fled in the opposite
direction.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the frightened deer flees at the sound of
cracking twigs and crunching leaves, so
fled Gyges, startled by his thoughts. He ran,
he knew not why. The dark streets through
which he passed were lighted only by lamps
burning before small shrines. Sounds of merry
laughter, of loud conversation, of joyful songs,
and of crying children came from the houses;
but he heard nothing. He took no note of the
dark shadows that seemed to flee to one side to
let him pass. The impulse to get away from his
horrible revelation drove him on, on, on, until
he arrived before the Temple of Julius Caesar
in the Forum. While he stopped to regain his
breath, he noticed that a slight mist was falling.
He felt a chill pass over him. The smoke that
came from the altar of the Temple of Vesta
hovered in the damp air. Here and there from
the windows in the palace of Tiberius on the
Palatine Hill near by could be seen flickering
lights.</p>

<p>His fine physique could not now prevent him
from falling a prey to the terrors of his excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
imagination. The keen eye that could judge distances
with nice exactness in the Circus Maximus
could now see no path before him. The hands
that could draw the reins and check the impetuous
plunge of his horses were stronger than his
will was to check the rushing of his thoughts.
His courage, that used to ring in his voice and
inspire the horses to make a supreme effort to
gain the finish line, melted now before the heat
of his convictions. His adamantine nature had
finally been pierced. He suffered under the
writhings of a tormented soul.</p>

<p>Resting against the rostra before the Temple
of Julius Caesar, he dropped his face into his
hands and breathed a pathetic “Oh-h-h” that
came from the profound depths of his soul. He
heard near by the footsteps of some one who
groaned at every step. He saw indistinctly in
the darkness the small figure of a lad.</p>

<p>“Ho, boy!” called Gyges.</p>

<p>The lad stopped and asked, “Who calls?”</p>

<p>“’Tis one who pities thee. Why moanest
thou?”</p>

<p>“O Master Gyges, flee! flee!” whispered the
boy, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ah! ’Tis thou, Aldo. What ails thee?”</p>

<p>“The soldiers are looking for thee.”</p>

<p>“For me? And why?”</p>

<p>“They have an order for thy arrest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“An order for my arrest? How didst thou
leave the stables? Does not thy back pain thee?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my master; but I wished to warn thee.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou go to my rooms?”</p>

<p>“Ay; the soldiers are there.”</p>

<p>“Whither hast thou been?”</p>

<p>“At thy new house. But hasten, O master!”</p>

<p>“Do the soldiers know of my new home?”
asked Gyges, quickly.</p>

<p>“Nay, master; they know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then come with me. Speak no more until
I command thee.”</p>

<p>With the strong arm of Gyges supporting that
of the stable-boy, they went along the Via Sacra
and around the Palatine Hill towards the Porta
Capena. It was the same walk that Psyche and
Gyges had taken a few hours before. The shutters
that closed the shops on the Via Sacra appeared
to Gyges like coverings of tombs. The
sparkling merchandise that had evoked such
pleasure in Psyche seemed to him now as black
as the abyss that separated the two lovers.</p>

<p>By the side of his master, Aldo bravely suppressed
all sighs and groans. He was a bright,
sprightly, slender lad of fifteen, with short light
hair, clear blue eyes, and small mouth. He spoke
quickly, with a sharp ringing voice. He was
descended from Greeks who had been slaves.
Gyges had bought him, and had taught him how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to care for horses. The little slave was devoted
to his master because Gyges had promised
him freedom. Both master and slave now
walked silently along. The mist had turned to
rain.</p>

<p>Arriving before his new home, Gyges rapped
sharply upon the door. At first no one answered.
He rapped longer and harder. Finally a voice
from within asked, “Who wishes to enter?”</p>

<p>“Open, Nana. ’Tis I!”</p>

<p>“What is thy name?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Knowest thou not my voice?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p>“Verily, ’tis thou, O Gyges,” exclaimed Nana,
as she opened the door.</p>

<p>Gyges and Aldo entered.</p>

<p>“What means thy visit at this hour?” asked
Nana, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Nana, prepare to hear sad and terrible
news.”</p>

<p>“Has any one died?” she asked excitedly.</p>

<p>“This boy has told me that the soldiers are
seeking me,” he cried, evading her question.</p>

<p>“What hast thou done?” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Gyges. “At the camp
they probably believe that I know a secret. Oh,
may the gods give thee strength to hear the other
horrible things that have happened this day!”</p>

<p>The voice of Gyges trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>In a frightened tone Nana said: “When thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
mother died, my Gyges, Nana became thy comforter.
Tell me all.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Nana; but this news is terrifying,” said
Gyges, shuddering. “Gannon is dead.”</p>

<p>“Gannon dead!” exclaimed Nana. “May the
gods comfort his family!”</p>

<p>“His parents have been arrested,” continued
Gyges, in a louder tone.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis not possible!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Psyche is a prisoner and I am pursued,” cried
Gyges, in a voice broken with anguish.</p>

<p>So overwhelmed by this sudden and horrible
news was Nana that she remained silent for
some time. Finally she softly moaned, “O
Mother of God, celestial Cybele, comfort us!”</p>

<p>“Ay, Nana,” groaned Gyges. “I feel as if
a crushing hand were thrust into my bosom and
were compressing my heart. But this poor lad
suffers. I pray thee go bathe and anoint his back!
Leave me alone with my burden of woe!”</p>

<p>She kissed his forehead, saying: “Words cannot
comfort thee. Thy spirit must wrestle alone
with this grievous affliction.” She paused a
moment and asked, “Wouldst thou have me light
a lamp?”</p>

<p>“Nay; the darkness of this room is brighter
than that which fills my heart,” he sadly replied.</p>

<p>As a feather drops from the wing of a soaring
bird and is driven aimlessly by the winds, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
were the thoughts of Gyges controlled by the
currents of his imagination. Alone in the room
that was to have been Psyche’s nuptial chamber,
he stood and deeply deliberated. Grave and ponderous
questions burdened him. Should he try
to escape? Should he leave Psyche defenceless?
How could he save her? What should he do
with his horses? He felt that he must act
quickly; but how? The darkness of night is
sometimes mocked by the lightning. The feeble
glitter that at first revealed hopes of safety in
flight now became a flash, and Gyges decided
to attempt escape. He immediately went to the
room where Aldo, greatly refreshed, awaited his
commands.</p>

<p>“How dost thou feel?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p>“I feel no more pain, only stiffness,” replied
the lad. “Curses rest upon the man who beat
me!”</p>

<p>“The blows were cruelly dealt,” said Nana.</p>

<p>“But come, we must act quickly! Aldo, return
thou to the stables!”</p>

<p>“O my master, can I not go with thee?”
pleaded the slave.</p>

<p>“Nay, boy; thou must care for the horses,”
replied Gyges.</p>

<p>“But Alvarus cares for them better than I do,”
cried Aldo. “Take me with thee, O my master!
Go not alone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Nay, I must go alone,” replied Gyges, firmly.</p>

<p>Tears flowed down the lad’s cheeks as he threw
himself on his knees before Gyges, crying, “At
the stables without thy protection they will kill
me.”</p>

<p>“And why?” asked the master.</p>

<p>“They hate a Greek slave,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“But thy back is not healed.”</p>

<p>“I can run and jump. See!” he said, as he
ran and jumped around the room, concealing his
pain like a little Stoic.</p>

<p>“Rest content; thou mayst go with me,” relented
Gyges.</p>

<p>The little slave nearly danced with joy.</p>

<p>“O Nana,” continued Gyges, “I know not
what to do. Who will now care for my horses?
They know my walk, my every motion. Their
gentle eyes follow me whenever I am with them.
They place their noses against my face and caress
me like human beings.”</p>

<p>“They were restless when I left the stable, O
master. They missed thee,” said Aldo.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ambrosia, Phaeo, Zephyrus, and Notus,
who will love you as I did? But come, Nana!”
he quickly called. “A light! I must write two
letters!”</p>

<p>Nana took a small terra-cotta lamp and preceded
Gyges into the small dining-room.</p>

<p>“How much money hast thou?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I have paid nothing for the household furniture.
I still have the money,” replied the faithful
Nana.</p>

<p>“Then give it me,” he gently commanded.
Nana left the room. When she returned, Gyges
had finished a short order. “Take this to the
banker Tullius, at the Basilica Aemelia. That
will procure for thee enough money to keep thee.”</p>

<p>“How long wilt thou be gone?” asked Nana,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I know not, my Nana,” replied Gyges.</p>

<p>“Whither goest thou?”</p>

<p>“’Tis best thou shouldst not know,” answered
the young master, sadly.</p>

<p>He now wrote another letter for Alvarus at
the stables. “Send this to the Circus Maximus,”
he ordered. “Let no one know it came from
here.” He arose and cried in a plaintive tone:
“Ah, that I should be obliged to leave Psyche!
But I may do more for her by being free. ’Tis
best that I should go. Come, Aldo! Guard well
this little home, my Nana. Care for it as if
Psyche and I were to enter it on the morrow.”</p>

<p>“That will I do, O Gyges,” said Nana,
weeping.</p>

<p>“Pray for her, O Nana! Pray for me,” he
softly said.</p>

<p>“Come, Aldo,” he added. “We must go. Go
thou by the Via Latina to Tusculum and await<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
me there at the theatre entrance. Here is some
money. Beg thy way. Use the money only
when necessary. Keep thy lips sealed. I shall
be at Tusculum at midday on the morrow. Fare
thee well, my Nana.”</p>

<p>“The gods guard thy life, O my Gyges!”
sobbed the good woman.</p>

<p>Wrapping their cloaks about them as a protection
from the rain, Gyges and Aldo left the
house. At the Porta Capena they separated, the
master taking the Via Appia, the road that led
to Albanum. He went directly to Alcmaeon’s
house. The door had been left partly open. As
Gyges entered, he felt the key in the lock on the
outside, as it had been left by Hera. With a
spark from the embers in the fireplace he lit a
lamp. The house was as dreary as a tenantless
cave. He felt some satisfaction at the prospect
of destroying Gannon’s message; but he could
not find the tunic. In a flash he concluded that
Psyche had confessed. He felt as if a breath
from an unfathomable abyss had breathed upon
his soul. “She is lost forever!” he groaned
aloud. As if incapable of further reasoning, he
unconsciously extinguished the lamp, locked the
door, hid the key, and went on his way towards
Albanum, with a heart completely crushed.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the border of a desert where vegetation
struggles against the arid breath of sterility,
appear smiling and restful oases. But these
oases perish, one by one, with the drying up of
the life-giving springs. When the flame of an
untempered summer burns out life, when the
brackish water sinks in the wells under the
spade of anxious man, when all the emerald isles
of the desert vanish until one only is left, there
arises in that one, amid the cries of overwhelming
despair, a fervent prayer for help and protection.
Such was the life of Agrippina,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
solitary grandchild of the Divine Augustus.</p>

<p>The early springtime of her life was filled with
sunshine and the blossoms of happiness. Her
mother, Julia, was the proud daughter and only
child of Augustus. Her father, Agrippa, was the
greatest general of his day, and a man of noble
character. She had three brothers and one sister.
All were smiled upon by Fortune, and all were
loved by Augustus and the Roman people. When
her father died, Augustus, still living, watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
over her and her family. Her widowed mother
then married Tiberius. The entrance of this man
into the Julian family was the ominous cloud that
first veiled the effulgence of her springtime.</p>

<p>She had married Germanicus, the son of
Drusus, and brother of Claudius and Livilla.
He was the noblest endowed, both in body and
mind, of any Roman of that day. He was a
man of handsome appearance, of extraordinary
courage, of wonderful oratorical talents, and of
powerful influence. Happy in the possession of
the love of this best of men, the life of Agrippina
was as beautiful and joyous as a perfect
day in spring.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the clear day of her life, her
brother Caius was murdered in Lycia. Eighteen
months later another brother, Lucius, was murdered
in Marseilles. Shortly after, her mother
was exiled to the island of Pandataria, and her
sister to another island, Trimetus. When her
mother left Rome, Tiberius crawled from his vile
nest at Rhodes, and braving the insult and opprobrium
of the people, came back to the city.</p>

<p>But the terrible disaster which then happened
to the legions under Varus in Germany threw
the aged emperor into paroxysms of grief and
fear. Too old to go in person to the borders of
the empire, he despatched Tiberius. The voluntary
retreat of the Germans removed the menace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that hung over Italy; but the people suffered the
indignity of seeing the standards of the Roman
legions fall into the hands of barbarians. Tiberius
was then recalled. The old emperor chose
him as his heir, in conjunction with Agrippa,
Agrippina’s only surviving brother. Some time
afterward Agrippa, becoming demented, was sent
away in exile. In making his final choice of an
heir, Augustus wavered between Tiberius and
Germanicus; but that important title was finally
bestowed upon Tiberius on account of his years
and military experience. Germanicus was forced
to become the adopted son of the new heir.</p>

<p>With increasing anxiety Agrippina beheld the
gradual extinction of her family. When her
brother Lucius fell a victim to the intrigues of
the mother of Tiberius, she was distressed, but
not dismayed. She was still loved by her aged
grandfather, for her noble character and virtuous
life. Before the emperor died she had given birth
to eight children. The first and second died in
infancy. A third, a boy, was so beautiful that
his statue, carved in marble, was placed in the
Temple of Venus on the Capitoline Hill. In the
bedroom of the emperor was placed a similar
statue, which Augustus kissed every time he entered
the apartment. But this child also died.
Of the other five children,—two girls and three
boys,—Caligula, the youngest, was three years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
old when Augustus died. Three years after that
event, the last child, Julia, was born.</p>

<p>With seeming tranquillity, after the adoption
of Tiberius as his heir, Augustus gradually withdrew
from the affairs of government. Germanicus
was ordered to take command of the legions
in Germany, and Agrippina accompanied him.
Drusus, the son of Tiberius, was sent to pacify
the mutinous legions in Pannonia. The emperor
passed the remaining days of his life at Capri,
Neapolis, and Nola. In the last-named town he
died. Soon after the death of this great man
Agrippa was murdered. Two years later Agrippina’s
mother was starved to death. Then in
the following year Germanicus was poisoned in
Syria.</p>

<p>Thus had the life of this noble woman been
blasted by the violent deeds of the Claudian
family. Thus, one by one, had dried up the
fountains that gave her life and courage. Thus
was she driven to one solitary comfort, to one
refreshing oasis,—the love of her family. For
six long years after the death of Germanicus she
had guarded her children with jealous care and
anxious forebodings.</p>

<p>Amid the legions in Gaul and in the palaces
of Syria she had passed with her husband the
last years of his life. She had once been gentle,
with a sweet disposition and a peaceful face. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
six years of her widowhood had embittered her
life. Her face was now impassive and determined,
her eyes piercing and melancholy, her
mouth nervous and firm. “The Mother of the
Camp,” as the soldiers had honorably addressed
her, the proud mother of nine children, and the
descendant of a family that had been pronounced
divine, would not bow her princely pride before
the vulgar and domineering son of Livia. Although
nearly crushed by disaster, yet she bravely
and imperiously carried herself through all her
tribulations.</p>

<p>With her six children she lived in a small
house that Germanicus had built near the Temple
of Jupiter Victor on the Palatine Hill. Alongside
and connected to the house by a crypto-porticus
was the sumptuous palace erected by
Tiberius. The contrast between the imposing
palace of Tiberius and the small house of the
daughter of divine ancestors aroused in the
Roman people sarcastic criticism.</p>

<p>The house of Germanicus<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was divided into
two parts,—one for the reception of friends
and clients, the other for family life. The part
where the family lived consisted of two stories.
The first story was on a level with the street,
which bordered it on three sides. In this story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
were the sleeping, dressing, and bath rooms.
The servants occupied the story above. These
stories were connected to the part where friends
were received by a narrow staircase, which
opened into the rectangular atrium, sunk considerably
below the level of the street. On one of
the long sides of the atrium were three halls or
rooms; on the other the vestibule, which was the
only entrance to the house. The vestibule connected
with the crypto-porticus that led to the
Palace of Tiberius. On one of the short sides
of the atrium was the dining-room; the other
was a plain wall. Near it was an altar that held
the family gods.</p>

<p>In the largest of the three rooms opposite the
vestibule Agrippina was reclining one morning
on a richly covered couch. Her son Drusus was
seated at her head, on a Syrian rug, which partly
covered the mosaic floor. A few days had elapsed
since the terrible death of Drusus, the son of
the emperor.</p>

<p>The lad Drusus was a graceful lad of fifteen.
He had an unhappy face, with dull black eyes,
a large mouth, with thick lips. He had just
returned from the palace on the Esquiline and
had thrown himself near his mother to report
what he had seen there.</p>

<p>“Is thy grandmother, Antonia, still at the
palace?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Ay, my mother; Julia has not left her room
since her father’s death.”</p>

<p>“Is she ill?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>“Not seriously,” answered Drusus.</p>

<p>“Verily, I must go and see her. And how is
thy aunt Livilla?”</p>

<p>“She smiled at me,” replied the youth.
“Truly, no one laments my uncle’s death but
his daughter Julia. Even thou, O mother, art
not sad.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my son, I have suffered and still suffer,”
sadly responded the mother. “Nothing but excruciating
sorrow can affect one who is constantly
beset with grief.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou not like Drusus, my mother?”</p>

<p>“In his death the family of Germanicus suffered
a great loss,” replied Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Why, O mother?”</p>

<p>“He loved thy father. He loved thee, thy
sisters, and thy brothers. He suffered from the
neglect of an unnatural father. Sejanus was his
enemy. Beware of that man, my son! Ay,” she
continued, as if dreaming, “Drusus loved us, but
his love brought with it the hate of Sejanus.
Now the minister, in these few days, has become
friendly. I repeat it, beware of that man! His
words are poison. Hast thou seen the emperor?”</p>

<p>“He will see no one but Sejanus,” replied
Drusus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“What news of Livia?”</p>

<p>“She is resigned. She also will not leave her
palace. But when my father died the whole city
put on mourning. Now the death of the emperor’s
son causes only an extra meeting of the
Senate.”</p>

<p>“Thy father was idolized by the people,” said
Agrippina, proudly. “Hast thou forgotten the
encomium that was pronounced when his body
was reduced to ashes? I taught thee the words.
Let me hear thee say them.”</p>

<p>The youth thought a moment and then began:
“He was as graceful as Alexander the Great;
of equally illustrious descent; in years the same;
both fell victims to the machinations of their
countrymen, in the midst of foreign nations; but
Germanicus was gentle towards his friends, moderate
in his pleasures; the husband of one wife;
his children legitimate. Had he been sole arbiter
of his destiny, had he possessed the sovereignty
and the title of royalty, he would have surpassed
Alexander in military renown as greatly as he
surpassed him in clemency, in moderation, and
in all other virtues.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast the best memory of all my sons!”
said Agrippina, smiling sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Where will they bury Drusus, my mother?”
asked the lad.</p>

<p>“In the mausoleum destined for our remains,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
replied Agrippina, “among the ashes of Marcellus,
Octavia, my father, Agrippa, thy great-grandfather,
the Divine Augustus, my brothers
Caius, Lucius, and Agrippa, and thy noble
father.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my mother; but Drusus belongs not to
the Julian family.”</p>

<p>“As husband to Livilla, my son, his ashes will
have that distinction.”</p>

<p>“Although I was but a child of nine,” said
Drusus, thoughtfully, “when I went with Nero
to meet thee, at Terracina, carrying the ashes of
my dear father, yet clearly do I remember that
day.”</p>

<p>“’Twas the saddest day of my voyage home,”
she sadly replied. “At Brundusium, O my son,
the country round about poured forth its people
so that the wharves, the buildings, and the temples
of that city were black with crowds clad
in mourning robes. In that dense throng were
friends and relatives, as well as officers and soldiers
who had served under thy father in many
campaigns. When the bireme that bore thy
father’s remains floated into the harbor of that
great city, a simultaneous groan arose from that
multitude. As I walked from the bireme, carrying
the urn that contained the ashes of thy father,
and followed by Caligula and the babe Julia, in
the arms of her nurse, men wept like women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
women like children. The journey from Brundusium
to Terracina was one long lament.”</p>

<p>“Ay, mother, I remember to have seen the
people throw stones at the temples, in anger that
the gods should have permitted that catastrophe.”</p>

<p>“Thine uncle Drusus has been called a stony-hearted
man; but when he met me at Terracina
he burst into tears,—may the gods grant peace
to his spirit! With him were Claudius, Nero,
Agrippina, Drusilla, and thyself, O Drusus. As
we moved on towards Rome, every temple along
the way poured forth clouds of incense. Traffic
ceased in the cities, and the people lined the
road in one compact mass. A catafalque covered
with wreaths and flowers and bearing the silver
funeral urn was borne upon the shoulders of
tribunes and centurions. At Albanum I was met
by the consuls, the Senate, the knights in purple
mantles, and the Roman people in black robes.
Their sobs and cries rent the air. Never before
had such mourning been seen and heard in the
streets of Rome.” As she lived over in memory
that sad journey to Rome, tears filled her eyes.</p>

<p>“Weep not, O mother,” said Drusus, laying
his hand upon hers.</p>

<p>“Ay, but what followed?” said Agrippina,
drying her eyes and sitting upright upon the
couch. “Did the emperor meet me? Did he pay
any respect to those precious ashes? Where was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Livia? The mother of Germanicus, Antonia, was
at home, prostrated. But, my son, where was the
public funeral that great men deserve? When
the father of Germanicus died, Tiberius met his
body, and, in the depths of winter, from the
snowy mountains he came on foot to the city.
At Rome, around the bier of that illustrious man,
were the images of the Claudian and Julian families.
In the Forum he was mourned. Encomiums
were pronounced on the rostra. Every
honor that could be conceived was heaped upon
him. But thy father, the great Germanicus, had
nothing. Except for the moaning of the people,
his remains were silently placed beside those of
his father and my Divine grandsire.” She
paused a few moments and then continued:
“Amid those groans could be heard passionate
exclamations. People cried: ‘The commonwealth
is lost! Henceforth there remains no hope for
Rome!’”</p>

<p>“Ay, O mother, despair not; for the sons of
Germanicus will sit on the throne of their father’s
hopes,” said Drusus, full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“But nothing, my son, pierced the heart of
Tiberius more than the titles bestowed upon me.
Then prayers—”</p>

<p>“Thy children know well those titles, O
mother. Do not hesitate to mention them. Of
a truth they were right when they called thee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
‘the ornament of her country, the only blood
of Augustus, and an unparalleled example of
primitive virtue.’”</p>

<p>“Then prayers,” continued Agrippina, slightly
smiling at her son’s loyalty, “were offered in the
temples for the preservation of you children, that
you might outlive your oppressor.”</p>

<p>“But the emperor loves the children of Germanicus,
O mother. Does he not provide for
them?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my son, he provides for them, but with
the wealth that should be theirs.”</p>

<p>“Does he not pay for the games that Nero
gives?”</p>

<p>“Ay— But didst thou not hear a noise?”</p>

<p>“What kind of noise?” asked Drusus, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Go into the atrium,” she whispered, affrightened,
“and see who has overheard us.”</p>

<p>Drusus rushed into the atrium, and in the
room that adjoined the one where his mother
reclined, he saw a servant conceal something in
the bosom of his tunic.</p>

<p>“What have you hidden there?” demanded
Drusus.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my master,” replied the servant,
as he hastened away.</p>

<p>“Hold!” cried Agrippina, as she appeared
in the atrium. “Move not a step! What ho!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Artus, Mano!” she called. When these two servants
appeared, she commanded: “Search that
servant; he has stolen something.”</p>

<p>In a moment Artus and Mano discovered,
hidden in the tunic of the servant, a tablet with
a stylus attached to it by a cord.</p>

<p>“Give it me,” said Agrippina. Rapidly glancing
at it, she read a portion of her conversation
with Drusus. “Ah!” she exclaimed. “Thou art
a spy! Beat him and send him into the streets!”
she ordered, as she smoothed away the writing
on the waxen tablet. There was a struggle as
Artus and Mano led the spy up the steps to
the servants’ quarters. Shortly after deadened
blows were heard, followed by cries and
groans.</p>

<p>“Oh that a descendant of the gods should be
subjected to such indignity!” exclaimed Agrippina.
“Even my words are copied and reported
to Tiberius! O son, I have spoken to thee plainly.
Thou hast good judgment. Speak not a word
of what I have said to thee. Guard well thy
words. Weigh each one of them. The walls
carry messages, the stones speak in these days
of terror.”</p>

<p>The calls of Agrippina and the tumult of the
servants had penetrated into the room of Caligula,
who was studying with his master. The
lad left his instructor and ran downstairs into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the atrium, crying, “What has happened, my
mother?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, my child. Go back to thy master.
A servant has been corrected.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more?” he asked in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Caius,” replied Drusus, smiling.</p>

<p>The little fellow quickly turned, ran up the stairs,
and was soon again at work upon his studies.</p>

<p>“Thou always callest him Caius,” said
Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Ay, my mother; I like not the other name.”</p>

<p>“Caligula is the name given him by the soldiers,”
said the mother.</p>

<p>“Caius pleases me better,” insisted the youth.</p>

<p>“Thy sisters, Agrippina and Drusilla, will then
remain for their midday meal in the house of
mourning with thy cousin Julia?” inquired Agrippina,
as she again reclined upon the couch in the
middle room.</p>

<p>“Ay, mother.”</p>

<p>“And Nero, where didst thou leave him?”</p>

<p>“He left me in the Forum.”</p>

<p>“Whither did he go?”</p>

<p>“He went to the camp to see Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Possibly the games will be postponed now
that Drusus is dead,” said Agrippina. “In one
year thou, too, my son, wilt reach the manly age.
By that time Nero will be wed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Whom will he wed, O mother?”</p>

<p>“The emperor has not made his—”</p>

<p>But she was interrupted by the appearance of
Nero, who entered the atrium, and sitting down
on his mother’s couch, sadly said, “’Tis over!”</p>

<p>“What has been decided?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“There will be no games,” said Nero.</p>

<p>Nero was the sixteen-year-old son of Agrippina,
and was her favorite because he had inherited
the manly bearing and the handsome
features of his father. His black eyes were
bright and quick, and his face was expressive
of joy and kindness.</p>

<p>“But I had already told thee that out of respect
for thine uncle’s death the games might
be prevented,” said Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I had thought they might be postponed,”
said Nero, in a disappointed tone.</p>

<p>“Who has told thee?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Sejanus,” answered Nero. “Instead, gratuities
will be given the people.”</p>

<p>“Strive higher, O my son, than to amuse the
people,” gently advised Agrippina. “Aim for
the greatest distinction that the Roman can bestow,—the
triumph. There is no more glorious
picture than that of a hero marching with his
captives along the Via Sacra towards the Temple
of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. Such honors
did thy ancestors enjoy. Be a true descendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of the Divine Julius and the Divine Augustus.
Be a true son of thy father.”</p>

<p>“Verily, I will try,” said Nero.</p>

<p>“Dost thou remember thy father’s triumph,
O Drusus?”</p>

<p>“Ay, mother. ’Twas a day that I shall never
forget.”</p>

<p>“’Twas the seventh day before the calends
of June,” said Agrippina. “Caius Coelius and
Lucius Pomponius were consuls. In that magnificent
procession, led by the Conscript Fathers,
there was one spectacle at which the people, carried
away by their enthusiasm, kissed their hands
and wept tears of joy. For, my children, more
splendid than all the gold or silver, ay, more
splendid than all the glories of this world, there,
borne aloft, were the standards that had been
recaptured by the valor of thine august father.
Ye were with him on that supremely glorious
day. But, my Nero, didst thou learn aught else
this morning?”</p>

<p>“Ay; on my way home I went into the Temple
of Concord,” replied Nero. “The emperor was
there. At last he has broken his silence. Seeing
the Consuls, out of respect for the dead
Drusus, sitting with the other Senators on the
ordinary benches, he upbraided them for lack of
dignity.”</p>

<p>“Did he appear sad?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Nay,” answered the eldest son. “When
some Senators shed tears, he censured them.
Without a sigh and with his usual hesitation
he made an address.—Oh for thy memory,
brother Drusus!—His speech was apologetic
and yet imperious. I forget the words.”</p>

<p>“My sons,” warned the mother, “be not embittered
when ye see the splendid funeral of
Drusus. Mark ye, the emperor will make of
that a grand display. Silently regard the
pageant. Let not thy words reflect thy thoughts
during the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Sejanus angered me this morning,” exclaimed
Nero.</p>

<p>“What said he?” asked Agrippina, anxiously.</p>

<p>“He compared the virtues of my father with
the vices of Drusus,” explained Nero. “He
said that the emperor would try to show that
the commonwealth had suffered a greater blow
than when my father died. So did he stir me
that I cursed—”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my son!” cried Agrippina. “Curse
no one before that man!”</p>

<p>“I cursed the fates who so wrongfully treat
us,” replied Nero.</p>

<p>“Ah, my son,” exclaimed Agrippina, reproachfully,
“have a care! Never let thy feelings overcome
thy judgment. I warned Drusus but a
moment ago to guard his words. Guard thine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
also. O my son, enemies lurk on every side.
But this morning, while talking with Drusus, we
found a servant transcribing on a tablet our conversation.
Even in our home we must be guarded
in our speech.”</p>

<p>“Thy favorite charioteer has run away, my
brother,” said Nero, looking at Drusus.</p>

<p>“Who? Gyges?” quickly asked his brother.</p>

<p>“Ay, Gyges,” replied Nero.</p>

<p>“What has he done?” inquired Drusus.</p>

<p>“I know not. He has been tracked to Albanum,”
answered Nero.</p>

<p>“But why should he run away?” asked
Drusus. “He was the most honest charioteer
in the Circus.”</p>

<p>“Ay. I know not,” said Nero. “He loved
the dancing-girl, Psyche.”</p>

<p>“The pretty little Greek?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Ay; she was to have danced at Pompey’s
Theatre,” explained Nero.</p>

<p>“Did he run away with her?” asked Drusus.</p>

<p>“Nay; she is in prison,” said Nero.</p>

<p>“What has she done?” inquired Agrippina.</p>

<p>“No one can say. Where is Caligula?” asked
Nero.</p>

<p>“He is at his studies,” replied the mother.</p>

<p>“He asked for a copy of Cicero’s orations,”
said Nero. “I have brought him this. What
ho! Caligula!” he shouted, as he went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
stairs. “But stay! I am coming up,” he added,
when he heard the light patter of Caligula’s sandals
on the stairs. As he met Caligula, Agrippina
and Drusus heard him say, “Master the language
of that great man, my brother, and thou wilt become
the best orator in Rome.”</p>

<p>“How happy thy brother is!” said Agrippina
to Drusus, rising from her couch. As she walked
towards the stairs, she added: “Cultivate a happy
nature, my son. ’Twill help thee overcome burdensome
grief.”</p>

<p>“Verily, I will try, O best of mothers,” he said
as she disappeared.</p>

<p>Left alone, Drusus threw himself on his
mother’s couch. The thought of the disappearance
of his favorite charioteer was uppermost in
his mind. Many times he had sat on the pulvinar
before the palace of Augustus, and had
watched the horse-races in the Circus Maximus.
With youthful enthusiasm he had regarded Gyges
as a hero. He had even entered the stables and
talked with him. “What will the green faction
do without him?” he thought. But his meditations
were checked by the entrance of Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Hail, Sejanus!” he said, as he sprang from
the couch.</p>

<p>“Hail to thee, O son of Germanicus!” said
Sejanus. “Where is thy mother?”</p>

<p>“With Nero,” replied the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“He is thy mother’s favorite son,” said Sejanus,
as he watched the face of Drusus.</p>

<p>“Ay; Nero is loved by us all.”</p>

<p>“By thee, too?” asked the minister, craftily
trying to sow seeds of envy in the heart of
Drusus.</p>

<p>“Ay, by me too! Why not?”</p>

<p>“He loves thee not,” answered Sejanus.</p>

<p>“How knowest thou that?” demanded Drusus.</p>

<p>“He told me but this morning that thou art
slow and easily imposed upon,” replied Sejanus,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Nero said that!” said Drusus, with a cry of
surprise.</p>

<p>“Ay; that and more,” continued Sejanus.
“But I do not wish to breed enmity between
brothers.”</p>

<p>“What more has he said about me?” commanded
Drusus, angrily.</p>

<p>“He says thou wilt never be a man,” replied
the wily Sejanus.</p>

<p>“And why?” asked Drusus, flushed with
anger.</p>

<p>“Be not angry if I tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, O Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“He says thou art advised too much by thy
mother.”</p>

<p>“No one seeks her counsel more than he does,”
cried Drusus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Princes of the blood of the Divine Augustus
should receive counsel from statesmen,” slyly suggested
the minister.</p>

<p>“I do not agree with thee, Sejanus. The
emperor has always been guided by his mother,
Livia.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Sejanus, for a moment caught
in bad reasoning by the answer of Drusus. He
quickly added, “But Nero said other things about
thee.”</p>

<p>Before Drusus could reply they were interrupted
by a loud knock at the door. A soldier
entered. Seeing Sejanus and Drusus, he said in
a loud tone, “Nero and Drusus are ordered by
the emperor to appear at once in the Temple of
Concord.”</p>

<p>“What ho, Nero!” cried Drusus, calling up
the stairs. “Come hither immediately!”</p>

<p>A few moments after Nero appeared, followed
by Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Hail to thee, O noble Agrippina, and to thee
again, O Nero!” said Sejanus, greeting them.</p>

<p>“What message hast thou brought, O Sejanus?”
asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Thou and I, my brother, are ordered by the
emperor to appear immediately in the Temple
of Concord. Come, let us go!” said Drusus.</p>

<p>“New honors may befall ye both,” said Sejanus,
as the two youths quickly left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“The death of Drusus has created mixed feelings
among the people,” continued Sejanus, addressing
Agrippina. “Some are sad, others are
happy.”</p>

<p>“Truly, no one is glad, O Sejanus?”</p>

<p>“Through the city reports are flying that the
Julian family rejoices,” he remarked, with a
crafty glance at Agrippina.</p>

<p>“’Tis not true! Drusus was a protector to
the Julian family,” challenged Agrippina.</p>

<p>“The heir to the empire a protector to rival
claimants!” exclaimed Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Ay; well dost thou know he treated my children
as his own,” said Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I know he tried to win the love of the people
by his mock protection,” sneered Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Revile not the dead, O Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Then the Julian family grieves?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The Julian family rejoices not over the grief
of others,” she replied, carefully choosing her
words.</p>

<p>“Where is thy mourning, O descendant of
Augustus?” he inquired. “When Germanicus—peace
be to his spirit!—died, the whole city
put on mourning. To-day few are clothed in
black.”</p>

<p>“Is that fault to be charged against the Julian
family?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he replied, vexed at her self-control.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Then he added: “The funeral of Drusus will
take place two days hence. ’Twill be a gorgeous
display. All the effigies of the Julian and
Claudian families will be borne in the procession.”</p>

<p>“The effigies of the Julian family are to be carried!”
exclaimed Agrippina. “But he had not
blood of that family in his veins!”</p>

<p>“Ay; effigies that were forbidden at the funeral
of the noble Germanicus are to be borne at the
funeral of Drusus,” he declared, rejoicing that
he had at last moved her.</p>

<p>“Are those the orders of the emperor?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Ay, O Agrippina,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then must we be content,” she most diplomatically
responded.</p>

<p>“Art thou not enraged to see these symbols
so dishonored?” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Nay; the Roman people must be the judges
of this act. The lips of Agrippina are sealed.”</p>

<p>“But the thoughts of Agrippina?”</p>

<p>“The thoughts of Agrippina are her own,”
replied Agrippina, imperiously.</p>

<p>“Thou speakest not freely, O Agrippina.
Surely thou canst trust one who wishes thee
and thy family well.”</p>

<p>“I trust no one,” she retorted, looking at him
so piercingly that he lowered his eyes. “My
house is an ear that gathers our conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
for a brain that is heated against us. But this
morning I found a spy writing down the words
I spoke to Drusus. Ah!—but I will say no
more.”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure he was a spy?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Why dost <i>thou</i> ask that question?” she bitterly
demanded.</p>

<p>“Who could wish to spy upon thee?” he asked
in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>“That is another question, answered before
asked,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Confide in me, O Agrippina,” he said in a
tender tone. “I revere the Julian family. Was
I not in the service of thy beloved brother Caius?
Did I not serve him well? The death of Drusus
opens the way for one of thy sons to rule. Nero
will now inherit the fortunes of the empire. I
will serve him as faithfully as I do the emperor.
Fear me not.”</p>

<p>“I do not fear thee, O Sejanus. I trust no
one,” she said calmly.</p>

<p>“’Tis no secret that the Julian family dislikes
Tiberius,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“’Tis no secret that Tiberius dislikes the
Julian family,” she returned.</p>

<p>“Come, O granddaughter of the Divine Augustus,
tell me thy complaints.”</p>

<p>“My complaints? I have none.”</p>

<p>“But thou sufferest!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“I suffer not.”</p>

<p>“Ay, thou art distrustful.”</p>

<p>“But distrust is not always suffering!” she
exclaimed. “I lack resolution.”</p>

<p>“Then thou hast fear,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“Nay, nor have I fear, O Sejanus. Distrust
has stunted the growth of my faith. Mine eyes
are shadowed by anxiety, my life is clouded by
doubts, but I do not fear.”</p>

<p>“Then if thou art so brave, I will withhold
my warnings.”</p>

<p>“To be distrustful, O Sejanus, hinders me not
from being grateful.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast said the emperor dislikes thee,”
he said. “I will add that thou art in danger.”</p>

<p>“Ha! the emperor wishes my death also?”</p>

<p>“Then thou accusest the emperor of causing
the deaths of thy relatives?”</p>

<p>“I said not so.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst use the word ‘also.’”</p>

<p>“Ay; but well dost thou understand my
meaning. I repeat it in other words. Besides
the indignities to which my family are already
subjected, he also wishes my death?”</p>

<p>“I will say, O Agrippina, that I advise thee
to refrain from eating at his table.”</p>

<p>“And then—”</p>

<p>“Good news, O mother!” cried Nero, joyfully,
as he rushed into the atrium, followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Drusus. At the sight of Sejanus Nero checked
his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“What has taken place in the Senate?” asked
Agrippina.</p>

<p>“When we entered the Temple of Concord,
we were led directly to the emperor,” said Nero.
“He took our hands in his and spoke. Repeat his
words, Drusus. Thou hast the better memory.”</p>

<p>“He said,” began Drusus, “‘These fatherless
youths I committed to my son Drusus to rear
and nourish as his own blood, to train them so
that they might be worthy of him and of posterity.
Now that my son has been snatched from
us, I address the same prayers to you, O Conscript
Fathers—’”</p>

<p>“Some of the Senators, at these words,
burst into tears,” interrupted Nero. “Proceed,
brother.”</p>

<p>“He said, still addressing the Senate,” continued
Drusus: “‘In the presence of the gods,
the face of your country, I conjure you, receive
into your protection, take under your tuition, the
great-grandchildren of the Divine Augustus,—children
descended from ancestors the most glorious
in the state; towards them fulfil your own
and my duty!’” Drusus delivered these words
like a young orator, using graceful gestures, and
giving well-marked emphasis to the phrases.</p>

<p>“He added more,” said Nero. “He said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
us: ‘Nero and Drusus, to you these Senators
stand in the place of fathers. Such are the circumstances
of your birth that the good and evil
which befalls you must needs extend to the
commonwealth.’”</p>

<p>Sejanus listened to the joyful words of Drusus
and Nero without comment and then said farewell.
As he turned away, he said to Agrippina
in an undertone, “The gods sometimes elevate
those whom they wish to destroy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PSYCHE had passed her second month in
solitude in the prison of the Praetorian
Camp. Her first days had been lived under the
crushing effects of her grief. Gradually the hope
that throbs in the heart of youth gave her some
consolation. Full of thankfulness for the warning
of Gyges, which had sealed her lips concerning
the writing on Gannon’s tunic, she concluded
that she had nothing to fear. There were no
proofs against her that could keep her under
restraint for a great length of time. But the
days passed slowly.</p>

<p>Her cell was a rectangular room, with a bed
in one corner. There were no openings except
a small grating that looked towards the Campagna.
For hours she would stand and look out
of this small window upon the enormous sweep
of cultivated land, bordered by the Sabine Mountains,
that appeared to frown upon the all-powerful
city of Rome. On clear days Tibur would
sparkle amidst the purplish-green background of
the mountains, like some little city seen in happy
dreams. The Viae Tiburtina, Nomentana, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Praenestina ran through the farms and cultivated
fields of the Campagna like large light-colored
veins on an enormous leaf.</p>

<p>But there were times when mountains, fields,
and even the prison seemed to the captive Psyche
to vanish in a cloud of oblivion. However, the
breaking of the cloud would reveal plaintive and
pleasant recollections of the past. Not as sensations
are stimulated by the impulsations along
the five different roads of the senses did these
recollections come to her, but as beautiful and
pure thoughts born from the sowing of seeds in
solitude.</p>

<p>She would think of her dear brother, the remembrance
of whose words and acts became
clearer since his death. The bright and happy
face she saw, the ringing words of cheer she
heard, the laugh that would irresistibly bring
smiles to other lips, the quick movements that
kept the watching eyes alert,—all these things
were in her dreams of her brother. “Poor
Gannon!” she would say to herself, “thy life
was like the incessant tremble on a summer
sea. Ah! poor, poor Gannon!”</p>

<p>Her home-life had been an experience of unbroken
peace. Her mother had been her only
friend in childhood, maidenhood, and womanhood;
and her father had found no pleasures
outside of his own family. She recalled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
happy evenings together when they would talk of
art, beauty, and the glorious country of Greece.
The songs that were sung after the evening meals
would come floating into Psyche’s memory like
sweet exhalations from rivers of melody.</p>

<p>With tearful eyes she would recall the happy
days spent with her lover. In imagination she
would see his strong, quick, and handsome figure.
She would hear whispered words of love that
would come to her like distant music from the
doors of a temple. So ardent were her recollections,
that she seemed to feel again his actual
caresses. The last afternoon they had passed together
appeared like some sunny day that would
never come again. She would take the necklace
he had given her and fondle it as if she saw in
the gems his eyes, and in the little golden links
the visible tokens of the ties which had bound
their hearts together during many happy days.
She pictured their lives like two votive candles,
waiting to be lighted upon the altar in the temple
of love.</p>

<p>On the second day of her imprisonment she
asked the keeper, “Knowest thou of a Greek man
and wife imprisoned in the camp?”</p>

<p>The keeper made no reply.</p>

<p>“Canst thou tell me whether a young man
named Gyges has been arrested?”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Tell me, O keeper, when shall I be free?”</p>

<p>Still there was no reply. Her words seemed
to die in the air before they reached him. Again
and again she repeated her questions, but received
no satisfaction. Her jailer was deaf and dumb.
With gestures she tried to procure a tablet and
stylus; but the jailer worked like an automaton
and she accomplished nothing. With no words
to break the stillness, she became like a daughter
of silence surrounded by profound solitude. In
her loneliness she would approach the thrones of
the gods, with offerings and prayers. The ways
were quiet along which her thoughts danced,
marched, and fell. Yes, in her world of silence
her spirit would hear celestial melodies and human
sobs; it would see bright thrones of her hopes
and dark beds of her sorrows; it would taste the
sweet juices of joy and the bitter acid of torment;
it would breathe the perfume of peace and
the exhalation of strife; it would gently touch a
living form and a dead body. But all these things
were the works of imagination. No messages
from her loved ones reached her through the impenetrable
and silent walls of her cell. She sat
as if immersed in oblivion.</p>

<p>Harrowed by the uncertainty regarding the fate
of Gyges and her parents, she passed her days in
hope, fear, and despair. One morning she was
surprised to hear a commanding voice give an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
order in the corridor. These were the first words
she had heard since her imprisonment. When she
recognized the voice of Sejanus, she gave a start.
She heard him stop before her door and order
that no one should be allowed to walk in the corridor
while he was there. When he had entered
and locked the door, he noticed that Psyche had
retreated to the farther end of the cell.</p>

<p>“Thou fearest me?” he said.</p>

<p>Psyche made no reply. She stood upright and
clenched her hands.</p>

<p>“Thou dost not fear me,” he said, answering
his own question as he sat down upon her bed.</p>

<p>Still Psyche remained silent.</p>

<p>“If thou dost not fear, thou must be glad to
see me,” he said with an evil smile.</p>

<p>“What dost thou wish here?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Be not frightened. I am not a severe man.
I have even refrained from torturing thee. I
keep thee and thy parents in the camp, on account
of laws that rule me. In my soldier
nature, O light-footed dancer, there runs a vein
of kindness. Thy brother was treated well in
the camp. I even promoted him. But in despair
at being caught in a dishonest act, he threw himself
from the roof of the barracks. Oh that he
might have given me an opportunity to forgive
him!”</p>

<p>“What dishonest act did he perform?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“He read my private letters.”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure, O Sejanus?”</p>

<p>“Ay; thy parents have confessed that he did.”</p>

<p>“Where are my parents?”</p>

<p>“They still live in the barracks, prisoners, as
thou art.”</p>

<p>“And Gyges, O Sejanus, where is he?”</p>

<p>“He escaped; but shortly he will also be a
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I thank the gods that he is free. But why
dost thou keep me here?”</p>

<p>“Thou hast told me that thou didst not read
the writing on thy brother’s tunic. I believe thou
didst read it.”</p>

<p>“I can say no more than I have not, O Sejanus.
Is it just to imprison innocent people?”</p>

<p>“Thou findest life a burden here? Thou wishest
to be free?”</p>

<p>“Ay, O Sejanus. Why am I kept here? Why
are my parents prisoners? Why is Gyges to be
arrested?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell thee, my graceful creature. Pray
be calm. Sit thou down near me.”</p>

<p>Psyche still remained in the corner of the cell.
She was frightened at the familiar tone of her
oppressor. She asked, “What dost thou wish
here?”</p>

<p>“I have come to relieve the monotony of thy
solitude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Then leave me. I prefer to be alone,” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>“So thou art the dancing-girl who delightedst
the people with thy impersonations?” he asked,
disregarding Psyche’s trembling appeal. “I have
seen thee dance. Truly thou hast mastered well
that art.”</p>

<p>“I am a dancing-girl. ’Tis an honest profession.”</p>

<p>“Ay; all professions are sometimes honest.”</p>

<p>“The life of a dancing-girl is sometimes misunderstood,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“Nay, O pretty one, not by me. The lives of
dancing-girls are never monotonous. A lover is
always at hand. Presents brighten their fleeting
days. Loving words and tender glances cheer
their lives. Art thou not lonely in this cell?”</p>

<p>Psyche knew not what reply to make. His
voice had become soft and enticing. She said:
“When can I see my parents? Persecute me no
longer, O Sejanus! I am innocent.”</p>

<p>“Thou art not persecuted, O pretty maiden!
Thy cell is bright; we have darker ones below
the ground. Thy food is good; we sometimes
only give bread and water. Thou art lonely and
I have come to relieve thy solitude.”</p>

<p>“Then leave me,” said Psyche, in a commanding
tone.</p>

<p>“Leave thee? Why, I too am often lonely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
This day I feel the need of some one to share
that loneliness with me. Come, sit thou down.”</p>

<p>“Leave me, I pray thee!”</p>

<p>“Thou art a dancing-girl and hungerest after
love.”</p>

<p>“Leave me, I say, I understand thee not,” she
cried.</p>

<p>“Dancing-girls need little instruction in the
art of love.”</p>

<p>“I have told thee that they are misjudged.”</p>

<p>“I have told thee that they are not misjudged
by me. Come, confess thy thoughts to me.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to confess.”</p>

<p>“Confess that thou dost love.”</p>

<p>“Love! Whom?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Love me,” he replied with a wicked smile.
“Confess that thou wishest to love me, as thou
didst love the youths at the theatre. Prison life
will soon lose its dulness if thou wilt love me.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand thy meaning!” said
Psyche, white with fear.</p>

<p>“Cell life has dulled thy senses. Come, sit
thou down. I ask not for thy respect, but for
thy love.”</p>

<p>“Respect! Love! Art thou mad? Thou, the
murderer of my brother; thou who art tormenting
my parents; thou who wouldst thrust into thy
dungeon an innocent man,—thou now comest
before me, before one whose heart is torn and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
whose wounds are still fresh, and, villain that
thou art, thou askest for love! Thou mayest be
the emperor’s minister, but there is a limit to
thy power! I detest thee! Leave me!”</p>

<p>“Hold, my pretty one! Thou sayest that I
am powerful. Ay; that is true. My power can
and will win thee. I have come here to love thee
and I will not leave without that satisfaction.”</p>

<p>With intense fear the poor maiden threw herself
on her knees and, looking up to heaven, cried
in tragic accents: “O Mother of God, Celestial
Rhea, hear the prayer from virgin lips! Deliver
me from the power of this fiend! Grant me death
rather than defilement! Protect thy persecuted
child! Save! Oh, save!—”</p>

<p>“The gods hear no prayers in the Praetorian
Camp,” jeered Sejanus, with an infernal smile on
his lips.</p>

<p>He approached her and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>“O Gyges, Gyges!” she screamed, struggling
against him with all her might.</p>

<p>“Struggle, scream, ay, yell! Thy cries fall on
deaf ears. No one can save thee.”</p>

<p>Although excitement gave her unnatural
strength, yet in the arms of Sejanus she was
powerless. He kissed her cheeks, though she
tried to avoid his caress by leaning backwards.
He whispered words of love, but she spat in
his face. She clutched his head in her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
and tore his hair. But this nervous force soon
spent itself, and she grew weak. She sobbed,
pleaded, and struggled; she called upon the
gods, but with no avail. Sejanus, like an enraged
beast, threw her on her straw mattress—but
a loud knock on the door arrested him.
Infuriated by the interruption, and fully prepared
to fell the man who had broken his strict
orders, he opened the door, and saw standing
in the corridor his master—the Emperor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE the emperor the anger of Sejanus
melted into mild servility. With customary
composure he greeted Tiberius as if nothing
whatever had happened. He locked the cell door,
and as he walked towards his office he said to
the emperor: “Truly am I tormented by that
wench. She knows a secret, and even slight
bodily punishment cannot unseal her lips. Verily
I shall be compelled to resort to painful torture
to learn the truth.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“I crave thy pardon, O Tiberius, but I will
answer thee in my office.”</p>

<p>When they had entered the business room of
Sejanus, both seated themselves at a cedar-wood
table, covered with reports and letters. Sejanus
was the first to speak. “Since the death of thy
son, I have already told thee, the friends of
Agrippina and Germanicus are jubilant; for the
brothers Nero and Drusus are now regarded as
thy successors. This woman with whom thou
didst find me has bought poison. She is in the
employ of Sosia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Sosia, the wife of Caius Silius and the friend
of Agrippina?” asked the emperor, greatly surprised.</p>

<p>“And thine enemy,” added Sejanus.</p>

<p>“What has Sosia done?”</p>

<p>Sejanus took up a tablet and read: “‘Sosia
received Agrippina in her palace three times in
four days. Sosia called at the Palatine to see
Agrippina the same number of times on the same
days.’ Their conversations at both places are
recorded,” added Sejanus, laying down the tablet.
“Germanicus was extolled. His death, they
said, was due to poisoning by Cneius Piso, acting
under thine orders. Sosia has openly made statements
reviling thee.”</p>

<p>“Agrippina is sowing her suspicions in the
hearts of her friends. The harvest will be a
large one,” said Tiberius, with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>“Caius Silius, the husband of Sosia, is equally
guilty,” continued Sejanus. “He was a commander,
as thou knowest, under Germanicus. He
has won many victories for his country. He
boasts too much. Here is his conversation with
Sabinus,” he said, pointing to a tablet.</p>

<p>“Titius Sabinus, the great and wealthy senator,
also talks against me?” gasped the emperor,
alarmed.</p>

<p>“O noble Tiberius, these men not only talk
against thee, but they are working against thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“But what of the son of Sabinus? Is he
loyal?” asked Tiberius.</p>

<p>“He is ruining himself with dissipation. He
frequents the taverns and consorts with dancing-girls,”
replied Sejanus.</p>

<p>“These men are too beloved by the people to
be thrust aside,” Tiberius said, with a significant
nod of his head.</p>

<p>“But believe me, O noble Tiberius, in the city
there is an undercurrent of discontent, set in motion
by these friends of Agrippina, that, if not
stemmed in time, will break forth into civil war.
Already sides are being taken, and I can prove
to thee that there are some who call themselves
‘partisans of Agrippina.’”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure of the information from Agrippina’s
house?”</p>

<p>“Ay, O great Tiberius; her maid faithfully
reports every two days. The servant who spied
for us before was caught. Agrippina had him
beaten and cast into the streets. The maid is his
sister. We have good reason to trust her reports.”</p>

<p>“What are thy suggestions against these great
men?” asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“Charge them with treason.”</p>

<p>“And Sosia?”</p>

<p>“Accuse her also.”</p>

<p>“Are there others who dare to talk openly
against me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Ay; through my spies I have learned of
Calpurnius Piso.”</p>

<p>“One of that illustrious and noble family is
also mine enemy!” exclaimed Tiberius.</p>

<p>“Ay; he has openly said he would abandon
Rome so as to be free from the despot and his
informers.”</p>

<p>“I have always hated Piso. Are there any
more traitors?” bitterly asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“Here is a list of them,” said Sejanus, handing
a scroll to his master. “Serenus is the most
important after Piso. Thinkest thou not, O Tiberius,
that our attack against Sosius and Sabinus
will quiet the others?”</p>

<p>“The others shall be marked men,” was the
significant reply of the emperor.</p>

<p>“If thou hadst the time to read these reports,
thou wouldst fear this seditious movement. These
men quickly seek notoriety amongst the people by
slyly whispering words of sympathy for Agrippina
and her children.”</p>

<p>“Sympathy for the she-wolf and her cubs,”
cried the emperor, “while the emperor receives
condemnation? For what? Is not the country
prosperous? Are not the poor fed? What does
Agrippina wish? Of a truth, O vigilant Sejanus,
is sedition spreading in the city?”</p>

<p>“Ay, more! I have learned that Agrippina
is encouraging her sons to form alliances with
the legions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“By Hercules! And through whom?” thundered
Tiberius.</p>

<p>“Sabinus.”</p>

<p>“By the infernal deities!” roared Tiberius, as
he clutched the arms of his curule chair. “She
is leaguing with the friends of Germanicus? Can
she not wait for my death? What greater honor
could she wish than my bestowing the hand of
my granddaughter Julia on her son Nero?”</p>

<p>“She has told Piso that she fears thou wilt
poison her.”</p>

<p>Tiberius pounded his hand on the table as he
said in his drawling tone: “Is that why she refuses
to eat when she attends my dinners? Ah!
she fears me!”</p>

<p>“Nay, she fears no one,” said Sejanus, recalling
his conversation with her. “She distrusts
thee and thy friends.”</p>

<p>“She insults me with her imperiousness. Her
cousin, Claudia Pulchra, is also insolent.”</p>

<p>“Cannot the pride of Agrippina be broken by
an attack on her dearest relation, Claudia?”</p>

<p>“Claudia is a model of purity,” said Tiberius.</p>

<p>“Models of purity can be easily remodelled,”
sneered Sejanus.</p>

<p>“What wouldst thou do?” asked the emperor.
“No one would take a case against her.”</p>

<p>“Domitius Afer, an orator, comes highly recommended,”
suggested Sejanus. “He is young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and has his honors to gain. Give him the case.
Bribed accusers can easily be obtained. Teach
the people, O Tiberius, teach Agrippina the respect
that is due thee.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that will I do. But what shall Claudia’s
crime be?”</p>

<p>“Prostitution, adultery, witchcraft, and spells
cast upon thee would be a good charge,” slyly
advised the minister.</p>

<p>“Adultery with whom?”</p>

<p>“Some one of your enemies,—Furnius.”</p>

<p>“Furnius, Furnius?” said Tiberius, trying to
recall the name. “Ay, he who writes lampoons
against me.”</p>

<p>“Ay, make the people hold their tongues.”</p>

<p>“Charge them both,” was his imperious order.</p>

<p>“Then, O noble Tiberius, Cremutius Cordus,
the historian, has written in his annals praises
to Brutus. He has even called Cassius ‘The last
of the Romans.’ Men are daring everything! Is
this not a direct insult against the Divine Julius
and the Divine Augustus? Shall annals be written
lauding men who fought for the Roman republic?
Let this stimulation of the republican
idea once course through the veins of the people
and the emperor falls, and with his fall the empire
will crumble.”</p>

<p>“Who has told thee this?”</p>

<p>“My agents are everywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Truly, O faithful minister, thine eyes never
close. Duty has become incarnate in thee.
Charge the historian Cordus with his crime.
All thoughts of the republic must be stifled.
Ah! even the Senate begins to act with freedom.
But the attacks against Sosius and Sabinus
will quiet that body. Behind their servile
flattery, which I abhor, there lurks bitter hatred
of me. Oh! verily must I leave Rome and its
people! Not a moment of peace is found here.”</p>

<p>“Ay, O worthy Tiberius, the hurry of business
in the city, the conflux of suitors in the palace,
and the suspicions of treachery everywhere,—all
these things burden thee too heavily. Art
thou still inclined to go to Capri?”</p>

<p>“Ay; near the shores of the Bay of Neapolis
I shall surely find rest and comfort.”</p>

<p>“In retirement and quiet, O Tiberius, the
greatest facilities will be afforded for deliberation
on important matters. At Capri thou wilt
be safe from the importunities of office-seekers
and from the intrigues of the dissatisfied.”</p>

<p>“Send to Capri! Have prepared for my reception
the palace where the Divine Augustus
spent his last days!” said the emperor, as he
rose to depart. “Order plans to be made for a
new palace to be placed on the higher inaccessible
cliffs. Ay, though eleven palaces are already
there, one is lacking to complete the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the divinities. Have prepared plans for a palace
that will outrival all the others. This new one
we will call the Villa Jovis. Fare thee well,
O honest minister!”</p>

<p>“Happy omens be thy speed, O mighty emperor!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT a year after the death of the emperor’s
son Drusus, the youth Sabinus and
the dancing-maid Merope were reposing on the
deck of a bireme bound for Piraeus. Other passengers
were grouped in the different parts of the
vessel. It was midday, and the sun shone from
a cloudless sky. The water moved by a gentle
breeze that blew from the glorious shores of the
island of Salamis. The bireme was three hours’
distant from its destined port.</p>

<p>“What are thy thoughts, my Sabinus?” asked
Merope, looking at him with her pure blue eyes.</p>

<p>“The gloom that enshrouded me when we left
Rome and Brundusium still hovers over me,” replied
Sabinus, gazing at the beautiful purple
mountains that form the shore line of the historic
island.</p>

<p>“But the day is bright and we are near
Athens. Throw off thy dreary oppression.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I fear that thy trip with me will be one
that thou wilt never wish to repeat.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not fear that thy father’s persecutors
will follow thee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Nay; but no Roman of a distinguished
family can be safe in these days of terror.”</p>

<p>“Thy father is not yet dead. Perhaps there
may be hope,” she said in a tone of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Ah! there is no hope,” he gloomily responded.</p>

<p>“But hast thou not many friends?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“One by one they have left me,” was his sad
reply.</p>

<p>“Even Sulpicius?”</p>

<p>“Ay, even he.”</p>

<p>“But why, O my Sabinus?”</p>

<p>“Since Sosius, my father’s confidant and
friend, voluntarily killed himself so as to escape
the horrible insult of an unjust sentence, and
since Sosia has been exiled, my friends have
become suspicious of me. I, who have done
nothing but revel in pleasures, am looked upon
as one who would try to conspire.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst conspire and won me,” said
Merope, forcing an air of gaiety.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Sabinus, laying his hand upon
hers. “But since the death of Sosius, my honored
father has been incessantly followed by
soldiers in disguise. He dared not leave Rome.
Didst thou ever see,” he suddenly asked her,
“Claudia Pulchra?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Sabinus; she is one of the most
beautiful women in the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“She has been strangled.”</p>

<p>“For what crime?”</p>

<p>“Friendship for Agrippina. They were
cousins. A purer woman never lived in Rome.
But she was accused of adultery with an obscure
poet, and both are now dead. Even Calpurnius
Piso destroyed himself because of the
attacks made upon him by the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Truly, the life of a dancing-girl is safer than
that of people in higher station.”</p>

<p>“Ay, thou art right, my Merope.”</p>

<p>“Tell me again why thou art leaving Rome,”
said Merope, as she watched a sea-gull floating
in the air above the bireme.</p>

<p>“When the blow struck the family of Sosius,
my father was charged with treason. But sufficient
proofs against him were wanting. Mark
thou, Merope, what plans Sejanus then formed.
Latiaris, who was always considered a stanch
friend of our family, was chosen as the instrument
to deal the final blow. He sent to my
father an invitation to a dinner, which was
gladly accepted. At the dinner were only Latiaris
and my father; but friends of Sejanus
were hidden in a room adjoining. The door
that led to that room was carefully covered by
a curtain.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ’twas a trap,” said Merope.</p>

<p>“Wait thou a moment. When the meal was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
half over, Latiaris addressed my father, praising
him for his constancy in his loyalty to the oppressed
family of Agrippina. He spoke at the
same time commending words about Germanicus
and bemoaned the fate of Agrippina. My father,
who worshipped Germanicus and who loved the
children of that wonderful man, was so affected
by the words of Latiaris that he burst into
tears. Carried away by his emotion, he spoke
against Sejanus; nor did Tiberius escape his
invectives.”</p>

<p>“Is it, then, forbidden the Romans to praise
their friends and criticise the conduct of the
rulers?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Merope. Such fear now hovers over
all the great houses in Rome that no one trusts
another. But hearken to what follows. While
my father uttered the words against the emperor,
he heard muffled voices in the adjoining room.
He feigned sickness, quickly left his couch, drew
aside the curtain, and entered the room from
which the sound had come. He beheld there his
worst enemies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a cruel plot!” exclaimed Merope.</p>

<p>“The sight of those men was my father’s death-warrant.
I know not what happened after that
horrible disclosure in the house of Latiaris. When
he returned home, he called me and ordered me
to leave the city at once. He gave me an order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
to sell at Athens his estates in Greece. With
money thus obtained, he hopes to save his family
from poverty; for at his death everything will
be confiscated. With tears in his eyes, he bade
me farewell. ‘I shall never see thee again, O my
son, my son!’ were his last words. Ah, Merope,
those who are able are leaving the city. Informers
are everywhere. Mayhap even our conversation
may be reported.”</p>

<p>Merope cautiously looked around them, but no
one was near. “Truly, such stories frighten me,”
she said.</p>

<p>“And, Merope, people are ofttimes charged
with saying words that were never uttered by
them.”</p>

<p>“When will this terror cease?”</p>

<p>“I know not, O Merope—but look at the
beautiful mountains. Oh, would that the spirit
which dwells in those lofty heights and that
which has seen history blossom and die, would
speak to doubting and tormented hearts!”</p>

<p>“Rather, would that life would always be as
gentle as this sea,” she slowly said. “But how
long shall we be at Athens?”</p>

<p>“When the estates are sold, we shall go to
Crete. In a few days my family sail for that
historic island. But come, let us try to throw
off our sadness. Those laughing eyes must be
as bright as the sky and not dimmed with tears.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
At Athens we will drink of new wine and be
happy in forgetting the world. Wilt thou not be
glad to see Athens?”</p>

<p>“Ay; we shall see pure Greeks there.”</p>

<p>“Ay; we shall see some Greek dancers.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou remember Psyche, O Sabinus?”</p>

<p>“The little Greek dancer at Pompey’s Theatre?
Ay, that do I.”</p>

<p>“I have often wondered what she did to be
arrested?”</p>

<p>“Is she not yet free?”</p>

<p>“Nay; Elea and I walked to her home some
time since. We found the door broken open and
the house bare of everything.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou recall the day we met her with
Gyges in the summer garden near the Temple
of Bacchus?”</p>

<p>“Ay; ’twas on that day she was arrested.
She appeared sad; dost thou remember?”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“She was the prettiest dancer in the Theatre.”</p>

<p>“Except thee.”</p>

<p>“She was all grace and refinement.”</p>

<p>“Too pure, Merope.”</p>

<p>“She was betrothed to Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Ay; he disappeared at the same time. Was
he arrested?”</p>

<p>“I know not. He drives no more at the
Circus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Psyche was to have danced her last time at
the spectacles given by Nero.”</p>

<p>“Ay; but Elea danced well at the games given
by Drusus,” said Sabinus.</p>

<p>“Elea cannot dance the rôles that Psyche used
to portray. But does not Drusus marry shortly?”</p>

<p>“He marries this very day, Merope.”</p>

<p>“Who will his bride be?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Aemelia Lepida.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Wealth always marries wealth.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Merope; but wealth creates envy; envy
leads to death and confiscations.”</p>

<p>“The Acropolis! The Acropolis!” shouted a
sailor, pointing to a white speck that glistened
like pure snow on one of the hills directly ahead.
Springing to their feet, the passengers looked at
that inspiring sight with the same eagerness
with which a sibyl would gaze upon a sacred
revelation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN depressed with distrust, when oppressed
with suspicion, and when burdened
with discontent, the heart looks to the
future, from which it hopes to drink the nectar
of peace. But the golden chalice from which
Agrippina had hoped to drink the blessings of
peace had become a brazen cup filled with intense
and increasing bitterness. Over twelve
months had elapsed since her beloved son Nero
had reached the manly age; and each month had
brought with it fresh disaster. So undermined
had her courage become that, when alone, her
soul, in terrible silence, listened and awaited the
next calamity without a respiration.</p>

<p>She trembled at the movements of the wings
of her imagination, at the fall of the withered
leaves of her hope, at the overflowing drops from
the fountain of her grief. The parched lips of
her soul craved a cool spring from which they
might drink of peaceful strength. She longed
for a strong arm that would help her carry her
burdens, for a confiding friend who would direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
her thoughts and actions, and for a tender heart
that would reciprocate her affection. For these
things did she strenuously seek as a grand oak
in the dark earth gropes for strength and
sustenance.</p>

<p>At times, so enshrouded was she by her danger
that the sun and moon appeared to vanish, the
world to disappear, and the stars to melt away.
Through the profound darkness of this oblivion
a beautiful face would sometimes glow and deceive
her. It seemed the face of hope. On close
scrutiny she would see around this face vipers
and snakes. It was the head of Medusa. With
her blood congealed by terror, Agrippina would
try to close the eyes of her imagination, but the
face of the horrible gorgon would still be before
her, turning into stones both her thoughts and
her actions.</p>

<p>During the year her son Nero had married
Julia, the daughter of Livilla, and had left the
small house on the Palatine Hill, moving into
the palace that belonged to his uncle Drusus, on
the Esquiline. Her second son, Drusus, had assumed
the manly robes, and having married
Aemelia Lepida, a descendant of an illustrious
family, lived in a palace on the Quirinal. Agrippina,
her oldest daughter, had been given in
marriage to a brutal and villanous man, Cneius
Domitius. The bitter seeds of hatred that Sejanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
had sown in the hearts of her sons had
now matured, and the brothers had become violent
enemies. With infernal art the malicious
minister had even succeeded in breaking through
the reserve with which Agrippina had received
him.</p>

<p>Tormented by the discord engendered in her
family and by the sufferings of her friends, the
poor woman had become dangerously ill. She was
now convalescing, and was permitted to receive
short visits from her friends.</p>

<p>Always alert, and never losing a chance to
advance his cause, Sejanus was the first to visit
the convalescent. When he called, Agrippina was
resting upon a <i>cathedra</i> in the atrium. Her face
was pale and thin, her eyes were still piercing
and melancholy. Although weakened by her illness,
she still bore herself proudly. She languidly
returned the greeting of the minister.</p>

<p>“Have I the honor to be the first among thy
friends to call on thee, O woman favored of the
gods?”</p>

<p>“I have no friends,” she coldly replied.</p>

<p>“Truly thou hast suffered!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ay,” she slowly replied.</p>

<p>“Thou art better?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My body is better; my mind worse.”</p>

<p>“Thy body should then control thy mind,” said
Sejanus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Would that my mind controlled my body!
Then would my body die.”</p>

<p>“But thou hast suffered pain. Convalescence
is a new birth, and thou wilt find life happier
when thou art stronger. A trip to Velletri or
Baiae would benefit thee. Wilt thou not go to
Baiae?”</p>

<p>“A prisoner doth not choose his cell.”</p>

<p>“What dost thou mean, O Agrippina?”</p>

<p>“The mind tied to this body is freer than
Agrippina is in her own home, watched by such
a vigilant jailer.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand thee,” said Sejanus, who
comprehended her meaning only too well.</p>

<p>“Have words lost their meaning since I have
been ill, O Sejanus?”</p>

<p>“Art thou still distrustful?” he asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I trust no one,” she impressively responded.</p>

<p>“What if the emperor should leave Rome?”
he said, as he watched her closely. Agrippina
did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>“He has daily been threatening for a year to
leave the city,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ay; but I believe he will go shortly.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If he leaves Rome he may never return.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Friends may become friends again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“While the emperor is away great events may
happen.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand thee,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Have words lost their meaning since thou
hast been ill?” he asked, quoting her own words
with an evil smile.</p>

<p>“If the emperor leaves Rome will blood cease
to flow?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The guilty will always suffer,” replied the
minister.</p>

<p>“Can friends greet each other without exile or
death being pronounced?”</p>

<p>“Honest friends have never been molested.”</p>

<p>“Was Claudia dishonest?”</p>

<p>“I fought to save her life more than thou
didst,” said Sejanus.</p>

<p>“It is terrible to think of that persecuted and
outraged woman,” said Agrippina, passing her
hand over her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ay; the blame of that deed rests with the
Senate.”</p>

<p>“That is hard to believe,” she said with a sigh.</p>

<p>Abruptly dropping this embarrassing subject,
Sejanus exclaimed, “Thy son Nero will rejoice
when Tiberius leaves the city.”</p>

<p>“Has he told thee so?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Nay; but he will be more free.”</p>

<p>“Thinkest thou so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“Ay. Nero is a promising son of the noble
Germanicus. He is beloved by the Senate.”</p>

<p>“He deserves their affection.”</p>

<p>“And Drusus is also beloved, but by the
legions. He prefers the life of a soldier.”</p>

<p>“Ay; but that will be denied him.”</p>

<p>“Why? When the emperor is absent, Drusus
may not be hindered from joining the legions. He
is a noble youth, and is loved by the Praetorians.”</p>

<p>“Speakest thou the truth, O Sejanus?”</p>

<p>“I have eyes and ears, and I can feel the pulse
of the legions as no one else can.”</p>

<p>“But what if the soldiers love Drusus?” she
queried.</p>

<p>“I will make reply to that question after the
emperor leaves the city. May the gods bless thee
and thy family, O granddaughter of the Divine
Augustus! I will not tire thee now with more
of my words. Fare thee well, O woman favored
by the gods!”</p>

<p>“Fare thee well, O Sejanus!”</p>

<p>After passing through this ordeal, Agrippina
breathed a sigh of relief. She recalled the words
that she had spoken, and analyzed them to see
what different meanings they might contain, but
she could recall nothing that could be construed
as treasonable. She called for a cup of water
and ordered a slave to fan her gently. While
she thus reclined on her comfortable <i>cathedra</i>, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
message was brought that the emperor was coming
to visit her.</p>

<p>She had not seen Tiberius since she had pleaded
before him for the life of her dear friend Claudia.
When he appeared, she remained seated and with
great dignity bade him welcome. The emperor
had become stouter. The pimples on his face
had disappeared, but in their stead ragged and
streaked scars had been left, resembling metallic
veins in an ugly piece of marble. When he
addressed Agrippina, he never looked directly at
her, but always gave her a sliding glance.</p>

<p>“The gods have been gracious to thee,” he
said to her.</p>

<p>“Ay, O Tiberius. For what ends?”</p>

<p>“Our lives are what we make them, O Agrippina.”</p>

<p>“True. There are those who smile at grief.”</p>

<p>“Where are thy daughters Drusilla and Julia?”</p>

<p>“They are with Antonia.”</p>

<p>“But this day I have chosen their husbands.”</p>

<p>“Couldst thou not have consulted me before
making thy choice?”</p>

<p>“’Twould have been useless. Even if we
might have consulted, thou wouldst have had
thine objections.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my objections to the villain thou didst
choose for Agrippina were well founded,” she
said with deep feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Cneius Domitius is descended from honorable
and illustrious ancestors,” replied Tiberius.</p>

<p>“The ancestors of Domitius<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are not to be
blamed for his vicious nature. Did his ancestors
ever kill a freedman because he refused to drink
more than he could hold? Did his ancestors riding
in their chariots cruelly and purposely drive
over children, crushing them to pieces? Where
is there in the record of the family of Aenobrarbi
one who thrust out the eyes of Roman knights
in small quarrels? But who are these men that
thou hast chosen?”</p>

<p>“Julia shall marry Marcus Vinicus; Drusilla,
Lucius Cassius,—both men of renowned families.
Thy daughters will not marry for some
years. I wish them to be taught to revere their
‘future husbands.’”</p>

<p>“Both are honorable men,” she said approvingly.</p>

<p>There was a studied and cold politeness in all
the words they spoke. Tiberius said, “I have
also come to deprive thee of thy son Caligula.”</p>

<p>“What wouldst thou with him?” she nervously
asked.</p>

<p>“Since the death of one of the twins of
Livilla, I propose to rear the remaining one
under mine own eyes. I wish that Caligula may
be his companion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Ay, O Tiberius; but he can be his companion
and still live with me. They will be near
each other, for thy palace and my house are
joined together. Ask me not to give him up at
his age.”</p>

<p>“There can be no reasons why he should not
live in the palace,” insisted the cruel emperor.</p>

<p>“Ay, but he is my youngest son and the only
one that is left me. Take him not away.”</p>

<p>“I have said,” he coldly replied. “He will be
free to come and see thee, and thou canst visit
him. He will not be poisoned there.”</p>

<p>“I fear not that, O Tiberius.”</p>

<p>“Then why dost thou object? He shall eat at
my table and shall be taught to trust me,—something
which his mother will not do.”</p>

<p>“Thou askest me to trust thee, O Tiberius?”</p>

<p>“The mother of Germanicus trusts me; his
wife fears me.”</p>

<p>“In the death of Germanicus Antonia lost a
son, I lost a husband and a protector.”</p>

<p>“Has not the emperor protected thee and thy
children?”</p>

<p>The bitter irony hidden in his words increased
the feeling of hate in Agrippina as she said,
“Thinkest thou, O Tiberius, that I am a lifeless
piece of clay, without memory, feeling, or
heart?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Agrippina!” he exclaimed. “Thou hast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
always regarded me through a veil of hate. Every
good act I commit becomes distorted.”</p>

<p>White with indignation, Agrippina interrupted:
“What hast thou done that no one dares to visit
me? Thou hast made friendship for Agrippina
a crime. Sosius and Sosia were persecuted because
they loved me. O Jupiter and ye celestial
gods! what crime did the pure Claudia commit?
Domitius Afer, an unknown lawyer, with bribed
witnesses, tried to prove her an adulteress and a
worker in witchcraft against thee. What reason
didst thou give me when I pleaded for the life
of that chaste and honest matron? Thy words
were, ‘She shall die.’ O Tiberius, her greatest
crime was her friendship for me! What has
Sabinus done? He loved my husband; he loved
me and my children. Of a truth, thou hast turned
every friend from me. Thou wouldst like my
children to hate me. Even my slaves are paid
by some one to spy and lie against me. Do I
look at thee through a veil of hate? Who holds
that veil?”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not reason calmly,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Afflicted as I have been, does it not surprise
thee that I can reason at all?” she bitterly asked.</p>

<p>“Thou placest the blame for thy troubles on
human agencies. What the gods have sent upon
thee thou shouldst bear with calmness,” was the
hypocritical reply of the tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Wouldst thou hate me less if I should respect
thee more?” she asked. “Is it thy wish that I
should grovel and fawn before thee, and thus
defile the blood of the Julian family,—blood
the purest and most illustrious in Rome?”</p>

<p>“I have asked of thee no favors. I bestow
them,” said Tiberius, contemptuously. “Caligula
shall come to the palace,” he continued relentlessly.
Then he added roughly, “Feed less,
O Agrippina, on thy daily bread of discontent,
which is filled with worms of hate, and thou
wilt be happier.”</p>

<p>During this conversation Tiberius paced up and
down upon the tessellated floor of the atrium, before
the altar that held the family gods of Germanicus.
He twitched his fingers, and from time
to time nervously adjusted the folds of his toga.
Agrippina spoke without anger, and with a certain
slow emphasis that made her words pierce
the pride and dignity of the emperor.</p>

<p>Her mind was so overwhelmed by the flood
of things she wished to say that at first she could
not think clearly. In answer to his remarks about
her food for reflection, she said: “I may eat of
that bread, O Tiberius; but who serves it? Upon
my bosom I have carried an invisible flower that
has weighed upon me like a stone. The noxious
odors that I have breathed in these past years
have so affected my nature that thou now seest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
a hideous figure. Mine eyes have so changed
that they have become spies upon my inner
thoughts. Upon my lips can now be read bitter
words that are not spoken. The light-hearted
maid who married Germanicus never knew a
care. What happened? Her loving brothers,
Lucius and Caius, were murdered. By whose
hands? Her mother was sent to Pandataria and
starved to death. By whose hands? Who was
it who murdered her brother Agrippa?”</p>

<p>“Cease thy invective,” ordered Tiberius.</p>

<p>But Agrippina ignored the order and continued:
“By whose orders was Germanicus poisoned?
Who has killed Sosius? Who has exiled
Sosia? Ay, who strangled Claudia? The
gods? Who but recently arrested Sabinus? Dost
thou wish that I should sing and dance? Oh!
the aroma from that invisible flower that drags
me down bears the odors of savage hate, of
murder, of stifling blood!”</p>

<p>Tiberius angrily said to her: “Thy words are
the emanations of a diseased mind. Thou wilt
talk more calmly when thou art well again. I
sacrificed but yesterday to the Divine Augustus,
and—”</p>

<p>“Such hypocrisy!” interrupted Agrippina.
“Is it consistent in thee to offer victims to the
deified Augustus and then to persecute his children?
His divine spirit was not transfused into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
dumb statues. The genuine images of the Divine
Augustus are the living descendants of his celestial
blood. I myself am one. Why dost thou
persecute me?”</p>

<p>“I understand thee, Agrippina. Thou thinkest
thou art injured because thou dost not rule.”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis not power I seek. Relieve my solitude.
Give me a husband. I am still young
enough for the married state. Cannot Rome
afford a man who would think it no dishonor
to receive the wife of Germanicus?”</p>

<p>At the announcement of this most just and
diplomatic request Tiberius started. He had
not thought her capable of such reasoning. To
have given her a husband would have been
a fatal mistake. He moved towards the vestibule
without making reply to this suggestion.
He felt that he must consult with Sejanus
before committing himself to such a project.
Turning to Agrippina, he abruptly said, as he
moved towards the door, “Our interview is at
an end.”</p>

<p>As he entered his palace, he was surrounded
by suitors and petitioners, whose noise so infuriated
him in his already angered condition that
he refused to see them. Entering his private
apartments, he immediately sent for Sejanus.
When the minister appeared, the ill-humor of
the emperor had moderated. “Two days hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
I leave Rome. Thou shalt go with me,” he
commanded.</p>

<p>“What means this sudden determination?”
asked Sejanus, concealing his inward joy.</p>

<p>“Rome has become unbearable. Among the
crowd of suitors and petitioners I recognize the
faces of too many whose friends have been condemned
according to the laws. Ay, I sometimes
meet my mother, who refuses to speak to me.
The she-wolf, Agrippina, continually shows her
teeth. Ay, we will leave Rome and strike from
a distance.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast, then, seen Agrippina?”</p>

<p>“Ay; but for her pale and thin face I would
say she had feigned her illness.”</p>

<p>“I too called upon her. She is as defiant as
ever.”</p>

<p>“Ay; Sabinus must be killed. The order for
his death shall be the first duty on our way to
Neapolis.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou question her?”</p>

<p>“Nay. She so used her invective against me
that I was forced to depart. If ’twere not for
her weakened condition, I would not allow her
to leave her home for a year.”</p>

<p>“She already calls herself a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“And whom does she call her jailer?”</p>

<p>“She asked me, ‘When will the emperor leave
Rome?’ I verily believe she will rejoice when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
she hears that thou hast decided to go away.
She said, ‘My friends can then come to see me.’
Truly, O Tiberius, she speaks too openly against
thee.”</p>

<p>“Ay; she received me proudly and talked imperiously.
Bah! Sejanus, I hate the very air I
breathe in this city of informers and evil-doers.”</p>

<p>“Who will go with thee to Capri?”</p>

<p>“Caligula and my grandchild. The pompous
cubs of Agrippina can live deceived by their
free conditions; but with Caligula at Capri I
will hold him as a whip above his mother’s head.
Let her understand that the life of her youngest
son depends upon her behavior. O Sejanus, no
longer can I endure the hypocrisy of the people
and the Senate! The city is a festering mass of
discontent, and I will purge it. At Capri the
offensive odors of insults, cries, and cursings engendered
by my cleansing will not be smelt. In
seclusion I will work. For years I have been
bound down. No freedom has been allowed me.
Men abused my very name. On their ribald lips
Tiberius Claudius Nero became Biberius the
drunkard, Caldius the infamous, Mero the sot.
Let them now tremble. How brave they were
in my retirement at Rhodes! My memory is
good and their names I well know. They shall
be taught that Biberius Caldius Mero never
forgets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Ay; but these are past wrongs,” said Sejanus.
“There are now present ones which demand immediate
attention. What shall be done with Nero
and Drusus? They are being taught that they
have been wronged; that their father, Germanicus,
was murdered by thine orders. Ay, these
sons of Agrippina are being told that the empire
belongs to them. The speech thou didst make a
year ago, when Nero assumed the manly robe,
is now being construed as evidence of thy weakness.
Mark thou, it was at thy request the Senate
passed resolutions allowing him to offer himself
for the quaestorship, five years before the law
permitted him. That was well. Look thou now
what followed. With no hint from thee, with
none of thy counsel or advice, and even in thine
absence, the Senate but a few weeks ago conferred
those same honors and privileges upon
Drusus. What means this? Has the emperor
no more power over these children of Germanicus?
’Twas the wish of the Divine Augustus
that Germanicus and his children should rule, but
it was not his will that they should usurp that
power. However, thou art above law. Thy will
can change even the wishes of the Divine Augustus.
Has not the time arrived when these children
should be taught that they owe their positions
to thee? Ah! go to Neapolis! Go to Capri!
Pull the strings from a distance and make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
people dance! Clean the city of intrigue. Make
the bones of those who oppose thee rattle in death.
The lesson will be severe; but a few deaths judiciously
administered will bring the people back
to the proper conception of loyalty to thee.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sejanus, thou art as necessary to me as
the blood that runs through my veins. Thy words
throb with the pulsation of my thoughts. Truly,
thou divinest my ideas before they are moulded
into phrases. We will teach the Julian family
that there is still left one of the Claudian blood.
The surviving twin shall be called the little
Tiberius.”</p>

<p>“Forget not, O mighty Tiberius, that away
from Rome thou wilt be untrammelled to revel
in dissipation. City gossip will not be heard at
Capri.”</p>

<p>“Are the pleasures of Rhodes to be enjoyed?”</p>

<p>“Ay! Even more! Sestus Gallus knows how
to contrive new pleasures. He was disgraced by
the Divine Augustus. Even thou didst once reprimand
him in the Senate for his openly lascivious
life. Now thou canst repay him by taking him
with thee.”</p>

<p>“Send for him. Send also for the poet, Asellius
Sabinus. His witty and unseemly verse will
enliven the evenings there. Make known to him
that my liberality will be no less than when I,
under the spell of Bacchus, presented him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
two hundred thousand sesterces for his poem
called ‘The Dispute between the Truffle and the
Fig-pecker, and the Oyster and the Thrush.’”</p>

<p>“Titus Priscus would be a good addition to
thy new household.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Priscus, who is ashamed to show
his face in Rome? Ay, send for him! Capri will
tremble with our orgies!”</p>

<p>Sejanus had never before seen the emperor so
contented. Now was the opportunity for which
he had waited. On the crest of this happy wave
he floated his great and ambitious desire. He
stood before the emperor, who had thrown himself
on a couch, and said: “Before thou leavest
the city, I would crave of thee a favor, O mighty
Tiberius. Thou hast been lavish in bestowing
upon me honors and distinctions. True, I am a
descendant of a Roman knight and have little
family record, still I am a supplicant before thee.
Accustomed I have been to the kindness of the
Divine Augustus, and subsequently to thy numerous
decisions in my favor. Therefore would I
rather address my hopes and prayers to princes
than to gods. Never have I sought the glare of
honors. Watching and toiling, like one of the
common soldiers, for thy safety has been my
choice. However, what has been most glorious
for me has been attained,—that is, to be thought
worthy of alliance with thee. Hence the foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
for my present hopes; since the Divine
Augustus, in the disposal of his daughter, had
considered even some of the Roman knights.
Therefore I beg thee, O noble Tiberius, if a
husband is sought for Livilla, that thou wouldst
remember thy friend, who would seek no other
advantage than the high honor of such an
alliance.”</p>

<p>“I will deal candidly with thee, O faithful
minister. By the marriage to Livilla, the partisans
of the house of Caesar would flame out
with far more fury. What would be the consequences
if by such a marriage the strife were
inflamed? Thou art deceived if thou thinkest to
continue in the same rank as now. Livilla, who
has already been the wife of Caius Caesar and
of Drusus, will not be satisfied to grow old with
a husband no higher than a Roman knight. Nay,
supposing that I suffered thee afterwards to remain
what thou art; believest thou that they who
saw her father, her brother, and the ancestors of
our house enjoying the highest dignities will ever
suffer such a marriage? However, neither thine
own inclinations nor those of Livilla shall be
thwarted by me. The secret purposes of my own
heart towards thee and the further ties of affinity
with which I am contriving to bind thee to me I
shall at present forbear to reveal. This only will
I disclose, that there is nothing too high for thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
virtues and thy zeal towards me to merit. When
opportunity presents either in the Senate or in
popular assembly, I shall not hesitate to express
my sentiments.”</p>

<p>“Most willingly do I yield to thy decision,”
said Sejanus, as he bowed himself from the
room.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last the emperor started for Capri. A
gorgeous litter, supported by six stalwart
Syrians, bore him to the Porta Capena, where
carriages awaited him and his party. Besides
the servants, there were with Tiberius the Senator
Nerva, the Knight Atticus, Sejanus, Caligula,
the little Tiberius, and a few Greek comedians.
To the Senate the emperor had explained
that his departure was occasioned by the need of
his presence at the dedication of temples in Campania.
The news of the emperor’s departure
spread through the city like the announcement
of a great victory of the legions. Crowds had,
therefore, collected along the roads that led to
the Porta Capena. At the parting signal from
the trumpets of the accompanying Praetorian
guards, there arose from the people a cry of joy
that penetrated the bosom of Tiberius like a sharp
poniard.</p>

<p>After a journey of four hours, Aricia was
reached,—a small village, embraced by the pine
woods of the Alban Hills. Here Tiberius owned
a villa that had once belonged to Clodius, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
bitter enemy of Cicero. From the beautiful flowered
terraces of this villa the whole sweep of the
Roman Campagna spread out like a vast rug,
woven by the deft fingers of some divinity. At
sundown Tiberius and Sejanus stood on one of
these terraces looking at the glorious panorama.
Turning to the minister, the emperor said, “Tell
me, O Sejanus, can there be in the whole empire
a view to compare with this?”</p>

<p>“How small Rome appears! Seems it possible
that in that speck there can be so much
dissension?”</p>

<p>“Ah, farewell to Rome and its deceptions!
Didst thou hear the cry of joy from the people
when we left the city? Bah! Let them hate me,
O Sejanus, so long as they fear me.”</p>

<p>As the ride from Aricia to Terracina would
require ten hours, the party must needs leave the
Alban Hills before the break of dawn on the following
morning. The emperor’s ill-humor and
bitterness had increased. Because his groom had
awkwardly fastened the emperor’s sandal, Tiberius
struck him and felled him to the floor. The
servant who had brought his morning meal was
sentenced to be deprived of food for three days,
because the meal was served cold. When they
changed horses at the miserable town of Forum
Appii, on the edge of the Pontine Marshes, the
displeasure of Tiberius had so increased that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
ordered his followers not to speak without his
permission. In consequence, the flippant talk of
the Greeks was hushed, Nerva and Atticus remained
silent, and the princes, Tiberius and
Caligula, spoke to each other only in whispers.
But on the heights of the beautiful town of
Terracina, in a comfortable villa fanned by sea-breezes,
Tiberius regained his customary composure.
He remained there a day to conduct
necessary business. After state affairs had been
attended to, letters received and answered, and
the terrible order forwarded for the instant
death of Sabinus, the party revelled in the mellow
wine of that luxuriant country. The lad
Caligula was plied with wine until he became
intoxicated, so that by his delirious antics he
might add to their amusement.</p>

<p>On the following day they went to Formiae.
They stopped for their midday meal at a villa
near the sea. The day being warm, the meal was
served in a grotto. Youths dressed as fauns and
satyrs passed the different courses, while young
maidens in gauzy attire danced before the revellers.
Suddenly, when the meal was at its height,
a bank of earth at the entrance to the grotto became
detached and fell in upon them all. There
was great confusion. However, every one escaped
serious injury. The emperor, moving too slowly,
had his feet caught by the falling earth. Seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
that all danger had passed, Sejanus quickly threw
himself over the emperor, as if to protect him
from further harm. At this show of absolute
self-sacrifice after all danger was over, Tiberius
loaded the minister with praises and expressions
of gratitude.</p>

<p>From Formiae the party went to Capua. In
this important and luxurious city Tiberius dedicated
the temple to Jupiter. From there, with
his followers, he went to Nola. In this town,
where the death of Augustus had occurred,
Tiberius dedicated a temple to his illustrious
predecessor. During the journey from Nola to
Neapolis the emperor again became sullen and
ill-humored. An officer whose duty it was to
precede the party neglected to remove a small
branch of a tree that projected over the road.
This negligence so enraged Tiberius that he commanded
the party to halt. Then, ordering the
officer to be stripped and beaten, he compelled
the party to watch the brutal punishment for this
trivial offence. Silenced by fear and by the emperor’s
displeasure, the party then quickly moved
towards Neapolis.</p>

<p>When they embarked for Capri, the bay of
Neapolis was as calm and innocent as a sleeping
child. The crystal air seemed alive with light.
Sharply outlined against the clear deep-blue sky
were the edges of the hills that nearly surround<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
that magic circle. The abrupt cliffs of Surrentum,
the peaceful slopes around Sabia, the gentle
sweep of the land between Vesuvius and Neapolis,
and the bold, volcanic islands of Procida and
Ischia, were gently kissed by the transparent
waters of that glorious bay. Between the promontories
of Surrentum and Ischia, Capri, with its
profile of a human face, appeared like a huge dark
sapphire on the bosom of the sea.</p>

<p>In the bay floated little sprigs of sea-weed,
purple fucus, like ravellings from kingly robes,
sea-grass and leaves, like waving hair and green
roses, watery flowers, as soft as feathery plumes
or lashes of dreaming eyes. Under the surface
were little sea-horses, swarms of tiny fish that
moved among branches of fleshy coral like humming-birds
among branches of small blossoming
trees. Medusae, living vacuities, trembled and
floated like transparent lilies detached from their
stems and imbued with life and motion. Ah!
the bay of Neapolis appeared like a huge flower-garden,
flooded with sparkling dew.</p>

<p>Circling the peaceful garden and crowning the
hill-tops and slopes, like an immortal wreath, were
the orange and olive groves of Surrentum, the
laurels and myrtle of Sabia, the vineyards and
fields of Vesuvius—that colossal verdant bell of
spring—the pines and cypresses of Neapolis,
and the vineyards of Procida, Ischia, and Capri.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
It seemed as if Nature were intoxicated with
beauty. It seemed as if celestial harmonies, borne
on the rays of light, touched the ears with an
infinite melody.</p>

<p>A gilded bireme, with purple sails and polished
bronze trimmings, floated gracefully on the lovely
bay, like some enchanted boat sent by the gods
to bear spirits to happy havens of peace. Attached
to the mast, the emperor’s golden ensign
languidly fluttered in the quiet air, like expiring
flames on a sacrificial altar to the goddess Flora.
Around the bireme were numerous small boats
filled with happy people dressed in bright colors.
Songs and laughter filled the air. Cheers and
acclamations gradually increased in volume as the
emperor and his retinue neared the shore. They
hastened into the small boats that awaited them,
and were soon conducted aboard the bireme. The
anchor was quickly raised, the poised oars began
to move with regular rhythm, and the boat
bounded forward like a living thing. The bow
cleaved the smooth water in gentle ripples, and
the dripping oars, when raised for the next stroke,
showered sparkling drops in the air like tears of
joy.</p>

<p>Every one was inspired by the gorgeous sight.
The emperor, looking at the retreating shores of
Neapolis, pointed out to his companions the different
villas that had once belonged to Cicero,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Lucullus, and Augustus. Some of the party
recited poetry; the Greeks sang extracts from the
Odyssey; Nerva quoted the following lines of
Virgil:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Nor Oebalus, shalt thou unsung from this our story fail,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom Telon on nymph Sebethis begat, as tells the tale;</div>
<div class="verse">When Teleboan Capreae he reigned o’er, waxen old;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose son might not abide to sit within his father’s fold.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Caligula and the lad Tiberius amused themselves
by watching the fishermen haul their nets and
the little nude boys rock small boats whose
edges gathered in water at every roll. Every
one seemed happy on this delightful day. It
seemed impossible that such tranquillity and
beauty could ever be ruffled by storms and
tempests.</p>

<p>As the mainland grew more and more indistinct,
the villas on the north side of Capri gradually
became more sharply defined. From the
gray rock, dotted with brush and small trees,
gradually came into view the bold marble-columned
front of one of the palaces built by
Augustus. The bireme took a course to the
south of the island, towards the palace where
Augustus spent the last days of his life. This
palace was more inaccessible than the others.
No one could approach it without being seen
by the occupants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>When the imperial party had arrived at their
destination, small boats conveyed them to the
shore. When he entered the palace, Tiberius
heaved a sigh, and said to Sejanus, “Thanks be
to the gods! We have at last arrived! Now
I am safe from the intrigues of Rome! Ah,
Sejanus, we should have sooner begun the
Villa Jovis. In one month I shall be higher
up the cliffs, where only the winds can reach
me.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou say that the Divine Augustus
lived in this palace shortly before he died at
Nola?”</p>

<p>“Ay, within these very walls, weak as he was,
he composed Greek verses. Come with me!” he
exclaimed, as he led Sejanus from the palace.
They slowly walked to the edge of the cliff.
“Yonder,” said Tiberius, “on the largest of
these islands that stand like sentinels guarding
the approach to the landing, the poet Masgabus
is buried, and— By the infernal Deities, what
is that object moving towards us?” he cried in
a tone of fear.</p>

<p>“It has the appearance of a huge sea-monster,”
said Sejanus.</p>

<p>Slowly creeping up the cliffs was a strange
object that had an uncanny look. Tiberius,
affrighted, called a soldier to his side. As the
singular object approached, it was seen to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
form of a man carrying a basket of fish. The
fisherman was one-eyed. His bronzed head was
bald; his unshaven face wrinkled and weather-beaten.
His toothless mouth was sunken. His
whole body was deformed by overwork. He
deposited his basket upon the rocks and, moved
by a feeling of loyal generosity, took from it the
largest fish, which he awkwardly presented to the
emperor.</p>

<p>Enraged that any one dared climb those slippery
and dangerous rocks, Tiberius ordered the soldier
to rub the fisherman’s face with the gift he had
just presented. “Is there a spot on the island,”
exclaimed the emperor, “where these things cannot
approach?”</p>

<p>“Thou treatest the man too kindly, O Tiberius,”
said Sejanus.</p>

<p>The fisherman smiled at such treatment, and
said to the soldier in his crude Latin dialect,
“I am glad that I did not give him the crawfish
I carried with me.”</p>

<p>“What didst thou say?” growled the emperor.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” stammered the frightened fisherman.</p>

<p>“For his insolence, take the crawfish and
lacerate his ugly face,” ordered Tiberius.</p>

<p>The cries of the poor fisherman were pitiable,
as his face was rudely torn by the claws of the
crawfish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Ah! henceforth the fishermen will avoid my
presence,” added Tiberius, with an ugly leer.</p>

<p>The next day Sejanus departed for Rome. He
carried with him a signed parchment, delegating
to him the imperial authority concerning all the
minor details of government.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW months after the retreat of Tiberius
to Capri, Livia, his aged mother, died at
Rome. The news was quickly conveyed to Tiberius,
but he excused himself by letter for not
immediately appearing at Rome, on the ground
that he was pressed with important business. He
had never spoken to Livia after she showed him
the abusive letters of Augustus. Such hatred did
he still bear her that he daily put off going to
Rome to attend her funeral. Appeal after appeal
was sent him to hasten, as the burial could not
longer be delayed. Finally he despatched Caligula
to deliver a eulogy in his stead. Out of
respect for the wife of the Divine Augustus, the
Senate passed a resolution calling her the “Mother
of her Country.” This the hateful son would not
allow. He even annulled her will.</p>

<p>After her interment and Caligula’s return to
Capri, the government assumed a character of
cruel and crushing despotism. Those who had
been friends of Livia were attacked and ruthlessly
killed. Letters of complaint were sent to the
Senate charging Nero with “lewdness,” Agrippina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
with a “turbulent and haughty spirit.” If
people compared these bloody times with the
peaceful reign of Augustus, they were killed.
Innocent criticism was punished by death. Freedom
of speech was stifled. Everywhere in the
city there was a feeling of distrust. The streets
of Rome appeared deserted. The surrounding
towns and the villas by the sea became crowded.
But even here spies were continually on the watch.</p>

<p>As if to increase the gloom that hung over the
city, a horrible catastrophe occurred at a small
town near Rome, called Fidenae. In this place
a freedman had erected a large wooden amphitheatre,
and having gathered gladiators from all
parts of the country, had promised a wonderful
exhibition. People flocked to the games and filled
the enormous structure. During the performance
the supports gave way, precipitating the great
crowd to the ground. Few escaped injury, and
over thirty thousand perished. Nor was this all;
for at Rome a violent fire broke out which consumed
all the houses and temples on the Coelian
Hill. The groan of the dying at Fidenae awakened
no sympathy in the breast of the tyrant at Capri;
but after the terrible fire on the Coelian Hill, the
cries of the homeless touched his heart to such
an extent that he ordered the public money to be
used in rebuilding the devastated district.</p>

<p>Amid all these catastrophes Sejanus did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
cease to execute his infernal plots. His greatest
desire had not yet been fulfilled. He had removed
only one obstacle from his path to ultimate power,—the
emperor’s son Drusus. By a stroke of
good fortune, Tiberius had withdrawn himself
from the city. Agrippina and her sons were the
last remaining obstacles to be set aside. By artful
and vicious enticing, he seduced the wife of
Drusus, making her, therefore, a spy upon her
husband. Through Livilla’s daughter, Julia, he
became informed of the innermost thoughts of
Nero. Through the young wives of these two
princes he worked their destruction. What evidences
of a treasonable nature were lacking in
the actions of Agrippina he supplied from his
fertile imagination. He made a last effort to
entrap her. In the atrium of her home, where he
had many times before questioned her, he accosted
her.</p>

<p>“Thou art jubilant, O Agrippina,” he said.
“Wherefore art thou so happy?”</p>

<p>“I am not happy, O Sejanus, but I am less
distrustful.”</p>

<p>“Still distrustful of me?” he asked; but receiving
no reply, he added, “What if I were to
tell thee that the emperor is a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“What wouldst thou have me say?”</p>

<p>“Mayhap the time is now ripe for thee and thy
sons to seize the altars of the gods and cry unto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
the people for protection. Truly, thou art now
more free, for thou receivest again thy friends.
Nothing, O Agrippina, hinders thee now from
seizing bolder and higher associations. Come, be
brave! With thy sons call upon the legions! The
power thou seekest is now within thy grasp! No
one will hinder thee! The Senate, the Roman
people, the legions, ay, Sejanus and the Praetorians
will all espouse thy cause! Say but the
word and thou shalt rule!”</p>

<p>“Ah! O Sejanus, these are treasonable words!
The honors of which thou speakest are not to
be seized by violence. Nay, when the gods
see—”</p>

<p>“The gods help not those who supinely wait,”
interrupted Sejanus. “Nay, O daughter of the
outraged Julia, nay, O mother of princes of celestial
blood, nay, thou, granddaughter of the Divine
Augustus, what is now required is action. Let
Sejanus honor thee! Let the true friend of the
Julian family—the man whom thou seemest to
reject as unworthy of thy confidence—let him
be the first to throw himself at the feet of the
mother of an emperor! Hesitate no longer, but
give me thy orders!”</p>

<p>These words of Sejanus were spoken in such
an earnest tone that Agrippina was at first deceived.
Gradually these treasonable utterances
awakened in her a sense of fear. She began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
divine a sinister motive in this seeming friendliness
of her old enemy.</p>

<p>“What if thy words should be heard by others,
O Sejanus?” she whispered in alarm.</p>

<p>“Why should I care for informers, if I am
trusted by thee and thy sons? I have seen Nero
but yesterday. I have spoken with Drusus. Messengers
await my command to carry orders to
the legions. Everything, O noble and worthy
Agrippina, is ready and awaits thy consent!”</p>

<p>“O Sejanus, thy words ring with the sound of
sincerity, but no violence shall be done by me.
If the people wish what thou sayest they do, let
them inform me through the mouths of my
friends. I charge thee, speak no more on this
subject and excite not the ambition of my sons!
Nay, O Sejanus, the robes of loyalty are not
always worn by those who speak the loudest. If
thou hast nothing better to offer than treasonable
words, thou art dismissed.”</p>

<p>The next report that was forwarded to the
emperor contained the treasonable words of Sejanus
as having come from the lips of Agrippina.
Nero and Drusus were charged with sharing their
mother’s traitorous purposes. The fate of Agrippina
and her sons awaited the final judgment of
the tyrant at Capri. Orders for their punishment
were immediately forwarded to Rome. The
mother was banished to the island of Pandataria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Nero was sent to the island of Ponza, and Drusus
was thrust into the dungeons on the Palatine Hill.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>While the people of Rome were suffering
under the tyranny of their violent ruler, Psyche
still remained in solitary confinement. Months
had passed, and the seasons with their varying
colors had painted the beautiful Campagna; but
the young dancing-maiden had lost all idea of
time. Day after day, through the weary months,
she had seen no one but her deaf and dumb jailer.
She had heard no voice but her own. However,
she lived in continual dread of another visit from
Sejanus. She would pace up and down her little
cell; she would gaze for hours upon the wide
Campagna; she would sometimes sing an Homeric
hymn; but the monotony of her life weighed
upon her like a heavy burden.</p>

<p>In her painful solitude, where no zephyrs wafted
a human sound, except her own sighs and sobs,
where no revelations came to her but in chimerical
dreams, she lived like some beautiful flower that
hangs over a dark abyss. All the pure springs of
her imagination, whether flowing gently in soft
but sombre shadows of love for her brother, in
calm shade for her parents, or in golden sunlight
for her lover, lost themselves in the main stream
in the valley of oblivion.</p>

<p>The summits of the hills of solitude are first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
kissed by the purple rays of religious light. They
cleave the air like bold thoughts; they repose in
majesty like infinite and immutable truths. From
their lofty tops words lose their power to paint
the revelations that come to the soul. Burning
upon altars on those lofty heights, the thoughts
give forth sweet incense mingled with profound
prayers. Ay, on these altars lambent flames of
meditations mimic the light of the life-giving sun.
Ah! But there are also valleys of solitude where
the sunlight never enters, where the tears of
cloudy days gather into one torrent and violently
score the river beds, where pale flowers struggle
against the cold breath from unsearchable caverns.
There are solitudes which humanity dares not enter.
There is a solitude where the mind itself
evanesces,—the terrible solitude of oblivion.</p>

<p>Such a solitude was Psyche’s; and from her
life all hope and joy had fled. Her very dreams
were beginning to vanish. Arid anguish pressed
her heart. Her ears like parched lips thirsted for
words. Her eyes like homesick souls longed for
the light of the sun. Her existence was immobile
but living, like the silence on lips that are
not dumb and yet do not speak. Oh the silence
of solitary confinement! Her life was an ocean
without a shore, overhung with sombre clouds.
From time to time there would appear on the
waters a wave both long and low. Only the ear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
accustomed to silence could hear that moaning
note. It sounded like a voice crying, with sad,
monotonous iteration, the word ‘<i>ob-liv-i-on</i>.’</p>

<p>One evening when she had finished her meal,
she heard some one speaking in the corridor.
These were the first words she had heard since
the visit of Sejanus. “What can it mean?” she
asked herself. She heard the key turn in the
lock, and when the door was opened she saw a
soldier.</p>

<p>“Prepare to leave at once,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Then I am free!” she screamed with joy.</p>

<p>“Nay, thy prison is to be changed.”</p>

<p>“But where shall I go?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt leave Rome to-night with another
prisoner.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a beautiful cloudless day in July. The
atmosphere quivered like the breath of a fire
over the wide Pontine Marshes. The intense,
stifling heat of midday seemed to come from the
infernal regions. In invisible clouds pestilential
vapors, breathing death, floated in the air. Luxuriant
vegetation that had fed on decayed plants
for centuries gave forth a putrefying and sickening
odor. Dragon-flies sported about in the fever-breeding
effluvium. For weeks there had been no
rain, and the stream that glides through the marsh,
like a river of death, was low and nearly stagnant.
By the drying up of the stream and the mire the
dust had encroached upon the marsh. Here and
there small whirlwinds of dust were twisting, like
venomous spirits of the air. Through this death-breeding
district, which appeared like a huge sore
on the fair plains of Campania, led the Via Appia,
connecting Terracina with Forum Appii. Over
the road the dust had drifted like snow, but unlike
snow it did not melt under the burning sun.</p>

<p>At midday the road was always deserted. The
beasts of burden and their drivers would rest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the inns and taverns until the sun slanted its rays.
But on this day a cloud of dust moved slowly
along the road. From time to time there appeared
in the cloud the glitter of a helmet, the
flash of a spear. A company of equestrian
soldiers were escorting a carriage drawn by two
horses. Evidently something urgent kept these
soldiers on the road this sultry, stifling day.</p>

<p>There being but a slight breeze, the dust fell
where it rose, covering the party with a thin yellow
layer. The horses breathed hard and sneezed
and snorted as the irritating dust penetrated their
nostrils. The sun at its zenith beat unmercifully
upon the cavalcade. With eyes half closed and
cast down, the men moved on, suffering under the
intense heat. No one spoke. The clanking of
the iron shoes of the horses and the rattling of
the swords of the soldiers were the only sounds
that broke the silence.</p>

<p>On, on, they marched, the perspiration rolling
like little rivulets down the soldiers’ cheeks,
through the coating of dust. The beasts’ flanks
were also wet with a mixture of dust and sweat.
Occasionally the officer in charge would give an
order so as to encourage the men. Some of the
horses began to stumble as they dragged one foot
after another. One of them with its sides bloody
from the constant spurring of its rider, was gradually
left behind the others. The rider dismounted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and with the flat of his sword began to beat the
beast. After vain efforts to keep up, the poor
horse finally stumbled and dropped upon the burning
road to die. The rider proceeded on foot.
The sun still relentlessly blazed, and scorched the
party. There was no tree along the road, no
place where shelter could be found, and there was
nothing to do but to travel on.</p>

<p>On, on, on, they went, becoming more and more
fatigued as each mile-post was passed. The carriage
rolled along the road like a funeral car.
From time to time there came from within the
drawn curtains the noise of clanking chains.
Coughs and gasps, produced by the stifling dust
and heat, were mingled with deep and prolonged
sighs. When the party arrived at the almost
stagnant stream, a boat conveyed the carriage
from one side to the other. While the carriage
was in the stream, the curtains were drawn aside
and one of the occupants looked out, but immediately
drew back. The sun burnt too fiercely.
The horses walked through the poisonous waters
and became slightly refreshed by the passage, but
the respite endured only a short time. Again
they were on the hot road, proceeding towards
Terracina.</p>

<p>The occupants of the carriage were Agrippina
and Psyche. Agrippina’s wrists were bound together
by chains. She rested her head on Psyche’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
shoulder. All night long they had been on the
move and she had had no rest.</p>

<p>“Is it not possible to obtain more air?” asked
Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I fear not, my lady,” said Psyche, in a tone
of forced cheerfulness. “Would that I could
bathe thy head with water, but even water is
denied us.”</p>

<p>“Ah! these chains are too heavy. Look how
they have cut my wrists.”</p>

<p>“Place the weight on the seat, my lady. There—does
not that ease thee a little?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my child. Why should I be shackled?”
she said, as she ground her teeth. “What do they
fear that I will do? They wish to humble me.
Ay, they treat me worse than a barbarian!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could but help thee, O my lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh! But this heat is stifling. Feel how it
comes through the cover. Ah, I must have water,
I must have water, I must have water!” she
feverishly stammered.</p>

<p>Psyche noticed a gradual increase of heaviness
upon her shoulder. She looked at Agrippina and
found that she had fainted. “Stop the carriage!”
she cried. “Help! help!”</p>

<p>The order “Halt!” was given, and the party
came to a standstill. Through the dust the officer
approached the carriage. He heard a call for
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“My lady has fainted!” cried Psyche. “Quick!
Help me! Give me some water!”</p>

<p>The officer poured some wine from a small
flagon into a wooden cup. He pushed the cup
between the curtains. After a few drops of wine
were poured between the lips of Agrippina,
she gradually became conscious. The dust
having slightly settled, the curtains were drawn
aside.</p>

<p>“Cannot this cruel ride be stopped?” asked
Agrippina, weakly.</p>

<p>“We cannot stop until we arrive at Terracina,”
answered the officer.</p>

<p>“But why such haste? Wouldst thou kill us
both?”</p>

<p>“My orders are unmistakable: ‘Proceed, without
stopping, to Terracina.’”</p>

<p>“Ay, but who gave these cruel orders?”</p>

<p>“I know not.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou forgotten that along this road I
did bear the ashes of Germanicus? Then the
people and the soldiers were in mourning. To-day
the same soldiers who wept when they saw
the widow of that great man deny her a cup of
water and a little shade. There is a tavern not
far from this stream. Where dost thou procure
fresh horses?”</p>

<p>“At that same tavern, my lady,” said the officer,
beginning to show some sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_246fp.jpg" alt="Agrippina and Psyche sat upon the deck of the vessel"></div>

<p>“There let us rest and cool ourselves,” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>Ignoring the petition, he asked, “Art thou
better?”</p>

<p>“Ay, but weak. Take from me these fetters.”</p>

<p>“That I cannot do.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou fear that I shall escape?”</p>

<p>“Nay; but the shackles must be worn until
Pandataria is reached.”</p>

<p>“But the hands of this child are free,” she
protested.</p>

<p>“Ay, but I cannot help thee. Come!” he said,
speaking to his soldiers. “Forward!”</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn together, and the party
continued on their way. The prisoners suffered in
silence until they arrived at a small inn where the
horses were changed. Then they were allowed to
alight. But the water they found there was brackish;
the wine bitter. Immediately after the horses
were changed, the order to proceed was given.
As they neared Terracina, the air cooled by the
sea gradually began to invigorate them. It was
near evening when they neared this small town;
but here they were again compelled to move on.
They were led down the steep cliffs of Terracina
to the shore, placed in a small boat, and rowed
to a vessel that awaited them. They were soon
on their way to Pandataria.</p>

<p>Refreshed by the salt breezes, Agrippina and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Psyche sat upon the deck of the vessel and watched
the smooth sea reflecting the setting sun. The
great orb was just hovering in glory over the
waters, and the skies were aglow with small flaming
clouds, clustered near the horizon. The peace
that always comes with the sunset hour brooded
over the waters.</p>

<p>“What island may that be yonder?” asked
Agrippina, turning to the officer who stood near
them.</p>

<p>“Ponza, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ’Tis the island where they have imprisoned
Nero.” She looked in the opposite direction
and saw another island. “What is that one
named?”</p>

<p>“Ischia.”</p>

<p>“Near Capri?” she asked, thinking of the
emperor in that beautiful retreat.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady.”</p>

<p>She said no more, but gazed vacantly at the
sea, lost in gloomy meditation.</p>

<p>“Art thou weary, my lady?” asked Psyche,
when she saw Agrippina close her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ay, my child; and thou?”</p>

<p>“I too sink under the burden of fatigue. We
have travelled fast and far.”</p>

<p>“Ay; we have made the entire journey from
Rome in one day. Truly such speed was shown
by our ancestors only when the enemy was in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
land. I know not why we were brought here in
such haste. Slaves are taken from Terracina to
Rome in two days. A descendant of the Divine
Caesar is hurried over the same road in one day.
Oh that the gods should permit such brutality!”</p>

<p>Again they relapsed into silence. The sun had
now disappeared.</p>

<p>The eastern heavens were heraldic blue, merging
into a paler blue at the zenith and gradually
melting into infinite gradations of purple, pink,
and red, as they approached the horizon, where
the clouds had now become iridescent, like mother-of-pearl.
Towards the land the water was an intense
dark blue; towards the west it reflected the
celestial colors of the dying day. The first star—the
boldest eye of the night—sparkled like
a vibrating point of fire. On such a night maidens
delight to rest on the hearts of their lovers and
breathe the peace of happiness, mothers rejoice
in caressing their children. But the emotions of
the poor prisoners were not stirred by the influences
of this lovely night; instead, they were
smothered by the darkness that enshrouded their
souls.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the island, night had
already descended upon the waters. They soon
disembarked, and were conducted to a small, one-storied
house. Agrippina said to Psyche, “’Twas
here my mother passed her last days, my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“As a prisoner, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” replied Agrippina, sadly.</p>

<p>“How did she die?” Psyche asked in a soft
low voice.</p>

<p>“She was starved to death,” replied Agrippina,
in a tone of anguish.</p>

<p>After they had entered the house, the officer
removed from Agrippina’s wrists the manacles
that had wounded them. A small supply of food
was given the prisoners, and then they were shown
their sleeping-rooms,—a large room with one
window that looked out upon the sea, connected
with a smaller room which had no window. Both
were plainly furnished with couches and <i>cathedrae</i>.
The large room was assigned to Agrippina;
the smaller to Psyche. The poor prisoners
were soon resting after their terrible journey from
Rome.</p>

<p>The morning after the arrival of the prisoners,
Agrippina reclined on a couch near the entrance
of the house. This building was located on a
desolate part of the island. There were no trees
to afford inviting shade, and the prisoners were
therefore obliged to retreat into the house to
escape the fiery rays of the sun. Psyche sat on
the tiled floor near her mistress.</p>

<p>“Tell me again thy name, my child,” said
Agrippina, with her melancholy eyes resting on
Psyche’s beautiful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“Psyche, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Thou art a Greek?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Why wert thou sent with me?”</p>

<p>“Perchance to be thy companion and thy servant,
my lady.”</p>

<p>“But who art thou?”</p>

<p>“I was a dancing-maiden. Now I am a
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Art thou the Psyche who danced at Pompey’s
Theatre?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady.”</p>

<p>“I have seen thee portray Niobe.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the character I loved best to portray.”</p>

<p>“But why art thou a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“I know not, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Where are thy parents?”</p>

<p>“They are also prisoners.”</p>

<p>“And their crime, my child?”</p>

<p>“I know not their crime, my lady. We lived
a peaceful life in a small house outside of the
city. In one short day our happy family was
torn asunder.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou a brother or sister?”</p>

<p>“I had a brother.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I will answer thee in Greek, my lady. He
was murdered!” said Psyche, glancing towards
the soldier who guarded them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“By whom?” asked Agrippina, also speaking
in Greek.</p>

<p>“By Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Sejanus the minister?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady. Gannon, my brother, was employed
as his secretary.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the atrocious villain has also destroyed
thy family!” exclaimed Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I have not seen or heard from my parents
or from my betrothed since the day I was led to
prison,” said Psyche, sadly.</p>

<p>“Thou wert to have been wed?”</p>

<p>“Ay; to the charioteer named Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Well do I remember the man who drives for
the green faction. Often have I seen him from
the palace of Antonia.”</p>

<p>“He was also sought for by Sejanus,” said
Psyche.</p>

<p>“But there must be some reason for such
violence. Why was thy brother killed?” asked
Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I will tell thee all I know, my lady. In the
office of Sejanus, Gannon was a secretary. He
wrote and translated letters. Sometimes he was
employed to carry messages. One day he happened
to read one. On the night of that same
day he was murdered.”</p>

<p>“How, my child?”</p>

<p>“He was thrown from the roof of the Praetorian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
barracks. The next day my parents were
arrested. At that very hour I was seated with
my lover in the peristyle of our new little home.
When I returned to my father’s house with Gyges,
two soldiers were waiting to conduct me to prison.
Perchance my parents are now dead,” she said
sadly. “Perchance Gyges, too, is dead.” And
she wept bitter tears as she thought of the possibilities
of their fate.</p>

<p>“Weep not, my child,” said Agrippina, resting
her hand caressingly upon Psyche’s head.</p>

<p>“The last words I had from my brother,”
Psyche continued, when she grew calm enough
to speak, “were those he had written upon a
piece of cloth which he had sewed to the under
side of his tunic. By chance only I read them.
Gannon’s body had been carried away. His tunic
lay in a heap on the floor. I took it up and kissed
it and I saw the writing. This was the message
he had written: ‘Have done wrong; read a
letter from L to S about Lygdus.’ Methought
the L must stand for Livilla and the S for
Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Who is Lygdus, my child?”</p>

<p>“Gyges told me that he was a eunuch and a
most cunning scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“My son Nero has mentioned a eunuch as
being employed by Livilla in her household. I
forget the name. When did this happen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Four days before the games of Nero, thy
son.”</p>

<p>“The day before Drusus died so suddenly?”
inquired Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Is the heir of the emperor, then, dead?” asked
Psyche, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ay, my child,” answered Agrippina, mechanically.
Suddenly she clutched Psyche by the
shoulder. With a wild stare in her eyes that
frightened the young maiden, she said: “Can it
be, my child, that Drusus was poisoned? Ay,
’tis true! I have often believed that Livilla and
Sejanus were lovers. Ye celestial gods! is it
possible that this woman conspired against her
husband?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my lady, that accounts for Gannon’s
death,” cried Psyche, as the mystery of her
arrest became plain; “now do I understand
everything.”</p>

<p>“It means more,” said Agrippina, with deep
emotion in her words. “Sejanus has murdered
Drusus; he has made Tiberius a captive at
Capri; he has, by his nefarious plans, charged myself
and my sons with treason. O Psyche,” she
cried despairingly, “Sejanus will be emperor
of Rome! And then there will be no help for
us!”</p>

<p>“But can nothing be done?” inquired the
trembling girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Letters to or from prisoners are not allowed,”
said Agrippina, despondently.</p>

<p>The prisoners had passed but a few days upon
the island when one morning the vessel that
brought food and orders to the soldiers brought
news that created great excitement among the
guards. It was early, and the sun had not yet
driven the people under cover. Agrippina and
Psyche were sitting on the rocks not far from
the house.</p>

<p>“Go, my Psyche! See what has caused such
excitement among the men!” said Agrippina.</p>

<p>Psyche hastened to the landing and inquired
what tidings had come from Rome. She heard
the story of the soldiers, and at first stood still,
not daring to return to her mistress. Agrippina,
seeing her hesitate, arose and went to meet her.
At the sight of Agrippina coming towards her,
Psyche hastened to her side.</p>

<p>“What has happened, my child?” Agrippina
quickly asked.</p>

<p>“I can tell thee better in thy room, O my lady,”
said Psyche, with pathetic calmness.</p>

<p>When they had entered the house, Psyche softly
said, “’Tis easier to carry news of grief, O sweet
lady, to those who are happy than to those already
weighed down with sorrow.”</p>

<p>“They have done no further violence to my
children?” asked Agrippina, excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Let my sharp words be dulled by the love I
bear thee, my lady. Rest thee on thy couch.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, my child, what news hast thou?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my gentle mistress, thy son Nero has
been strangled at Ponza!” As she said these
words, she hid her face in the robe of her mistress.
At first Agrippina said nothing. The
shock of this terrible news dulled her mind.
Her face became white; her eyes frightful. She
gasped. She ran her fingers through her hair
and acted as if demented. Finally she spoke,
but her voice was a hoarse whisper: “And this
will be the end of all my children. Was ever
woman born who has endured such suffering as
mine has been? My cup of bitterness was already
full. This added woe but strangles me as I drink.
Tears have deserted mine eyes. The springs of
my grief are dried up. Oh! my life is an arid
desert, and those who have loved and trusted me
have left their whitened bones strewn along the
pathway of my weary life. What is it that keeps
our spirits bound to our bodies when we yearn
to tear them asunder?”</p>

<p>“May the mother of the gods comfort thee,
O sad and grief-stricken soul!” said Psyche, as
she burst into tears of tender sympathy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT what of the young charioteer? What
had Gyges been doing while Psyche was
enduring the weary months of her hopeless imprisonment?
On the day after the rainy and
despairing night of his flight from Rome, he
met Aldo at Tusculum, as had been agreed upon.
Together they then lived among the oak woods
and in the small villages in the Sabine Mountains,
until the vigilance of their pursuers gradually
decreased. They then went to Casinum, a
small town on the Via Latina. Here Gyges found
accommodations with a farmer who lived on the
outskirts of the town. In order that his muscles
might retain their strength and flexibility, the
charioteer exercised himself by working in the
fields and vineyards.</p>

<p>However, this monotonous life became too irksome.
Gyges hungered for the excitement of the
Circus and the companionship of his horses. He
prevailed upon the farmer to give him a stable.
He then ventured to Capua and bought a young
unbroken stallion. Again he went and bought a
second. Finally he became the happy possessor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
of four spirited steeds. So adroitly did he train
them that in a short time they knew his every
word, and they could run four abreast without
the use of reins or harness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while he trained his horses, he
did not cease to be tormented by the fearful uncertainty
of Psyche’s fate. In everything he did
or refrained from doing, her influence seemed to
stimulate or to restrain him. In the temple of
Apollo, that rested on the mountain towering high
above the city, he would fervently offer up a
prayer to the sun-god for her deliverance. On
the summit of the mountain, which afforded one
of the most beautiful views in Italy, he would
rest between the marble columns of the temple
and drink in the inspiring sight. His thoughts,
like birds flying along the ways of the winds to
their nests, would revert to his betrothed. He
seemed to see in the bright flashes of the far-distant
sea her glances; in the solemn mountain-tops
covered with verdure her virtues covered
with purity; in the bright valleys her depressed
spirits. In the sparkling, transparent stream
that gently touched the small town and sang
a gentle song of peace, he pictured her precious
life.</p>

<p>But the knowledge that Sejanus instigated the
murder of Drusus, that Livilla acquiesced, and
that Lygdus committed the horrible deed, burdened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
him with the same feeling that weighs
upon the criminal when in breathless expectancy
he awaits the sentence of death. Whether absorbed
in sad meditation upon the past, or partially
engrossed with the affairs of the present,
his knowledge of the crime seemed to cut him
like a double-edged sword. Perpetually fed by
the oil of his fears, his conviction appeared to
glow within him like a lamp whose flame cannot
be quenched.</p>

<p>After the first two months had passed, he could
no longer bear the suspense under which he lived.
He must know how Psyche was. He finally
concluded to write to Macro, the officer in the
Praetorian Camp who had been Gannon’s first employer
and who had been a friend of Alcmaeon.
Macro was also well known by Gyges. Many
times had the soldier gone into the stables at the
Circus and learned from Gyges the perfections,
the faults, and the nice little points about horses
that only thorough horsemen know. Together
they had tried many horses that were to be bought
by Macro for the use of the soldiers. Gyges
therefore felt that he might divulge his hiding-place
to Macro without fear. One day he decided
to send Aldo to him with a letter, asking information
about Psyche and her parents. He procured
a horse for the boy and despatched him on
his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Guard well the letter, Aldo,” he cautioned.
“Let no one see it but Macro. Go not to the
stables at the Circus. Thou art not known in the
city, but be seen as little as possible.”</p>

<p>“Fear not, O master. No one but Macro shall
receive the letter,” said Aldo, as he nervously sat
astride the horse, awaiting leave to start on his
mission.</p>

<p>“After thou hast received Macro’s reply, go
to Nana and tell her that all is well with me.
Guard thy words. Speak only when spoken to.
Go!”</p>

<p>Six days after the lad had left Casinum he
was back again, bright and happy and bursting
with news.</p>

<p>“They are well!” he called to Gyges at a
distance.</p>

<p>“Didst thou see Macro?” he cried, as the horse
and rider approached.</p>

<p>“Ay, and right glad was he, O master, to
hear from thee,” said Aldo, as he sprang to the
ground.</p>

<p>“What message did he send by thee?” asked
Gyges, eagerly.</p>

<p>“He left me for some time. When he returned,
he said only these three words, ‘They
are well.’”</p>

<p>“And Nana? Didst thou see her?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my master. I told her what Macro had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
said and also that thou art safe. She cried with
joy.”</p>

<p>“Good heart!” said Gyges, smiling at the
thought of Nana’s emotion. “Didst thou see
any one else?”</p>

<p>“Nay, master. I longed to see the horses at
the stable, but I dared not go.”</p>

<p>Gyges became as happy as a child when he
heard that Psyche was safe and well. Each
month he sent Aldo to Rome with reports to
Nana and with inquiries to Macro. He was
thus informed of the emperor’s departure from
Rome and of Psyche’s removal to Pandataria.
The last visit of Aldo brought news that startled
Gyges. Macro had been appointed sub-prefect of
the Praetorians. This position placed the soldier
second only to Sejanus. Gyges rejoiced at the
promotion of his friend, and believed that now
some means could be arranged whereby he could
communicate with Psyche.</p>

<p>However, the knowledge of the crime of Sejanus
still burdened the mind of the charioteer.
He felt that he must tell some one the horrible
secret. “Why should I not see Macro and tell
him?” he reasoned with himself. “If the emperor
could but learn through Macro that
Drusus was murdered, the soldier would receive
still higher honors. I will write Macro
and try to appoint a place of meeting. Ah!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
he said to himself, “perhaps the freedom of
Psyche may thus be secured!”</p>

<p>He wrote a letter and sent it to Rome by Aldo.
Six days passed; seven; then eight; and Aldo
did not return. Vague feelings of alarm took
possession of Gyges. He could not believe that
Aldo had been arrested, but he was tormented
by doubts and fears. On the ninth day the lad
returned, happy and smiling as ever.</p>

<p>“By Mercury, Aldo! Thou hast given me
great fright!”</p>

<p>“The fault was not mine, my master. Macro
was out of the city.”</p>

<p>“And thou didst await his return?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my master.”</p>

<p>“Thou art a good lad, Aldo. Thou hast truly
earned thy freedom.”</p>

<p>“I do not seek to be free, my master. I wish
to live always with thee.”</p>

<p>“But where is Macro’s reply?”</p>

<p>“He wrote nothing. He read thy letter carefully;
then said, ‘Kalends—Tusculum—house
of Junius—night.’”</p>

<p>“That is three days hence. Well do I know
the honest Junius. Where didst thou stay while
in Rome?”</p>

<p>“In thy new home, my master.”</p>

<p>“Nana is still well?”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, and anxious to see thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Gyges shook his head sadly. “She may wait
long,” he said. “This night, my boy, I start for
Tusculum.”</p>

<p>“Am I to go with thee?” was Aldo’s eager
question.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lad. Thou wilt remain here with
the horses.”</p>

<p>Travelling by night and concealing himself by
day, Gyges safely arrived at Tusculum. On the
evening of the Kalends he knocked at the door
of the house of Junius.</p>

<p>A slave opened the door.</p>

<p>“Thy lord Junius is within?” Gyges inquired.</p>

<p>“Nay,” was the reply. “What wouldst thou
here?”</p>

<p>“I seek Macro, the sub-prefect of the Praetorians.”</p>

<p>“Macro now is master here. Junius is dead.
What is thy name?”</p>

<p>“’Tis needless to give my name. I pray thee
tell him that a horseman wishes to see him.”</p>

<p>The slave closed the door. Soon after he reappeared
and said, “Enter.”</p>

<p>“Hail, O sub-prefect!” said Gyges, when he
saw his friend Macro waiting in the atrium to
receive him.</p>

<p>“Hail to thee, Gyges!” said Macro. “I feared
thou wouldst have difficulty in reaching here. I
should have sent thee a passport, but I am watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
too closely in the camp. Come apart with me and
let me hear thy story.”</p>

<p>He led Gyges into an adjoining room and
locked the door behind them. Taking a lighted
lamp from a pedestal and carefully looking around
the chamber, he went into a second room, locking
the door between these two apartments. There
were no openings in the last room except that of
the closed door. “We shall be safe here from
informers,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where is Junius, O Macro?” inquired Gyges.</p>

<p>“Dead,” replied Macro. “His property was
confiscated. I have bought this house.”</p>

<p>“Of what sickness did he die?”</p>

<p>“Of a malady far too common in these times,”
replied Macro, bitterly. “He was wealthy. Sejanus
wished his money, and informers charged
Junius with treason. The good and innocent man
opened his veins. But come, O Gyges, tell me,
why wert thou arrested? Why were Gannon’s
parents and sister put into prison? In the camp
I can learn nothing of their crime. They were
guarded by special servants of Sejanus. Through
a soldier I learned of Psyche’s departure. Ah!
there are many mysteries in the Praetorian Camp
that even the sub-prefect cannot unravel!”</p>

<p>“Art thou sure that no one will overhear us?”</p>

<p>“Ay; I have carefully locked the doors. But
come! I cannot hide myself long. What secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
hast thou that will make the greatest man in
Rome tremble?”</p>

<p>“Dost thou know Lygdus?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p>“Ay; but I know no good of him,” said Macro,
with a frown.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“That I know not. What knowest thou of
him?”</p>

<p>Coming close to Macro, Gyges whispered in his
ear, “<i>He murdered the emperor’s son!</i>”</p>

<p>Macro started back aghast. “How dost thou
know?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What I shall tell thee, O Macro, will seem
incredible. Thy master plotted the death of
Drusus, Livilla abetted the dastardly plan, and
Lygdus committed the terrible deed.”</p>

<p>“By the gods! Gyges, these are startling assertions!”
said Macro, doubting the truth of the
terrible charge made by Gyges.</p>

<p>“Ay, but there are sufficient proofs,” said
Gyges, confidently. “Gannon was at one time
employed by thee, if I mistake not.”</p>

<p>“Ay; and he was the brightest lad I ever had
in my employ,” said Macro.</p>

<p>“Later he was transferred to the office of
Sejanus,” continued Gyges. “He carried messages
for thy master.”</p>

<p>“But that means nothing,” said Macro, impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Wait thou a moment,” returned Gyges.
“Hear my story. One day he carried a letter
from Livilla to Sejanus, and read the letter—I
know not why. That same night he was
thrown from the roof of the barracks. He was
murdered!”</p>

<p>“Gannon murdered? ’Tis impossible!” exclaimed
Macro.</p>

<p>“Nay, O Macro; ’tis too true! The poor boy
wrote on a piece of cloth these words, ‘Have done
wrong; read a letter from L to S about Lygdus.’
The piece of cloth he sewed to the under side of
his tunic. These words were the last he ever sent
to his family. The L and S, my Macro, stand for
Livilla and Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“But there is no proof in this,” objected Macro.</p>

<p>“Why were Alcmaeon and Hera arrested the
following day?” asked Gyges, significantly.</p>

<p>“I know not,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why was Psyche imprisoned?”</p>

<p>“I know not that, either.”</p>

<p>“Why have I been sought?” persisted Gyges.
“Is there not a reason to suspect that a great
crime has been committed, when such innocent
people are hunted and hurried to prison? Listen
to what follows. Thou knowest that Lygdus is
one of the greatest villains in Rome. Why should
his name be associated in a letter between Livilla
and Sejanus? I was with Psyche when she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
arrested. We were at Alcmaeon’s house. We
entered and saw lying upon the floor Gannon’s
tunic. By chance we read the words I have told
thee. I went to the camp with Psyche and warned
her not to acknowledge having seen the writing.
After I left her I went to the house of Lygdus.
He was not there. I then went to the palace of
Drusus and asked the gate-keeper if Lygdus had
entered. I learned that the eunuch had but that
morning entered the employ of Livilla. Mark
thou, <i>Livilla</i>—not Drusus. While I was talking
to the gate-keeper, there were hurried calls
for litters. I retreated, and watched the people
as they came out in wild disorder. It was said
that Drusus had died suddenly. Filled with the
fear of my convictions, I waited a little longer.
Sejanus appeared. He entered, and a short time
after came out with Lygdus. The eunuch remained
close to the gate. That is my story.
The writing on Gannon’s tunic is the clue to it
all.”</p>

<p>“Ye gods! can it be true?” exclaimed Macro.</p>

<p>“Canst thou doubt it?” asked Gyges.</p>

<p>“Nay; I can believe anything about Sejanus.
But why hast thou kept silence so long, Gyges?”</p>

<p>“To whom could I tell this story and be
believed but to thee, Macro? As soon as I
heard of thy promotion, I communicated with
thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“By Hercules, O Gyges! It may be too late!”
exclaimed Macro.</p>

<p>“What dost thou mean?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Now do I begin to understand clearly
the plans of Sejanus. By the gods, O Gyges!
<i>He is the emperor!</i> He has already strangled
Nero. Agrippina and Drusus are in prison.
Verily do I believe that Tiberius himself is a
prisoner at Capri!”</p>

<p>“Ye gods! Has the power of Sejanus become
so great? But where is Livia?”</p>

<p>“The mother of Tiberius is dead,” replied
Macro.</p>

<p>“What! has she too been murdered?” exclaimed
Gyges.</p>

<p>“Nay. Verily do I believe she died of a
broken heart,” replied Macro.</p>

<p>“But is there no one with whom thou canst
communicate?” asked Gyges, despairingly.</p>

<p>Macro thought for a moment, and then replied:
“Ay, there is Antonia; but she is the mother of
Livilla. However, I will see her and procure a
letter from her to Tiberius. I will be silent about
her daughter. Sejanus only will I accuse. Ay,
Antonia can, and she will, help us. She is the
only one in Rome whom Tiberius seems to
respect. How can I thank thee for thy information,
my Gyges? How can I ever repay
thee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Let me but see my Psyche, O Macro. Let
me but send her a letter is all I ask.”</p>

<p>“But there are important duties now to be
done,” said Macro, thoughtfully. “All communications
that go to the emperor must pass
through the hands of Sejanus.”</p>

<p>“Then no word can be sent to the emperor?”
anxiously asked Gyges.</p>

<p>“Hold!” exclaimed Macro, excitedly. “I
possess a duplicate seal of Sejanus. He gave
it me to sign his correspondence. That will help
us. But come! I must return to Rome this
night. Meet me here two nights hence.”</p>

<p>“But I may be prevented,” replied Gyges.
“Thou knowest that I am sought by the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“I will give thee a passport—” He hesitated
a moment, and then added, “Perchance ’twould
be better that thou shouldst rest here in this
house until I return.”</p>

<p>The sub-prefect immediately departed for
Rome. “Fare thee well, O Gyges!” he said,
as he parted from the charioteer in the atrium.
“Thou hast made the name of Macro great.”</p>

<p>“Happy omens be thy speed, O future prefect!
Fare thee well!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE wind was howling around the bleak
cliffs of Capri. Huge waves dashed and
broke against the rocks below. On the eastern
heights of the island the newly completed Villa
Jovis was lost in the clouds. Sheets of rain fell,
drenching the island and the surrounding country.
Frightful lightnings flashed, and tremendous thunders
rolled. The beautiful white columns and
statues and the massive walls of the courtyards
caught the wind and held it until it escaped with
violent whistlings and shriekings. Fields of maturing
vines were gutted out by raging torrents.
Havoc and ruin relentlessly stalked through
the island, uprooting trees and throwing down
buildings. A tempestuous sirocco was at its
height.</p>

<p>Down in the depths of the palace, in a vault to
which no daylight could penetrate, the cowardly
Tiberius, with a wreath of laurel on his head,
crouched, trembling at every burst of thunder.
From time to time he would ask what signs there
were of clearing. A statue of Victory fell from
its pedestal into the courtyard below and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
dashed to pieces. The noise of its fall was heard
by Tiberius. The tyrant trembled.</p>

<p>“What was that noise?” he shrieked.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a servant replied, “The statue
of Victory has fallen, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Call the astrologer!” Tiberius commanded
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Bid him quickly come!” repeated the emperor.</p>

<p>When the astrologer arrived, he quieted the
terror-stricken emperor by telling him that an
enemy who had long been victorious would soon
be crushed.</p>

<p>“But who is mine enemy that has been long
victorious?” asked Tiberius.</p>

<p>The astrologer did not directly reply, but asked
in turn, “Is there no one who rules over thee,
O emperor of the Romans?”</p>

<p>“Mine enemies are either dead or in prison,”
replied the emperor.</p>

<p>“All thine enemies?” the astrologer asked
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Ay, all mine enemies. Wherefore dost thou
doubt?” demanded Tiberius.</p>

<p>“I doubt thee not, O worthy emperor. I have
long warned thee that some one was subtly plotting
against thee, but thou wouldst not believe
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Nay; I must have proofs,” said the emperor.</p>

<p>“What better proof couldst thou demand,
O mighty emperor, than that which has just
been shown thee? The statue fell to-day; proofs
should then arrive to-day.”</p>

<p>“Who would dare venture upon the water
to-day?” asked Tiberius, mockingly. “Ah, thou
readest signs badly. No one— By the infernal
gods! hear that thunderclap!” he exclaimed,
greatly terrified.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord Tiberius. The storm has now
spent its force and will soon abate,” prophesied
the astrologer.</p>

<p>“The Villa Jovis is well named,” cried the
emperor. “The ruler of the gods has protected
his august name.”</p>

<p>Although intended for a residence, the Villa
Jovis was in reality a fortress. It was built on
an elevation, on three sides of which cliffs dropped
perpendicularly into the water. The fourth side,
which connected with the lowlands by steps, was
protected by a massive wall. Two gates led into
the villa. The first gate was easy of access; and
between it and the second the visitor was carefully
searched before he was allowed to enter.
A feeling of insecurity had seized the emperor,
and he had stationed soldiers on the walls and
around the grounds, as if the villa were in a state
of siege. On the mainland heights of Surrentum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
not far distant, soldiers were also placed, to give
warning by flag-signals when a boat approached
the island.</p>

<p>For one whole day no one had dared venture
upon the turbulent waters. The emperor therefore
anxiously awaited reports from Rome. After
the last violent peal of thunder there was a breaking
of the clouds. The lightning became less violent.
Tiberius then crawled from his hiding-place,
like an animal afraid of a revenging attack. He
called Caligula, and together they approached the
small portico outside of the semicircular triclinium,
or dining-room. The emperor still wore on
his head the wreath of laurel.</p>

<p>“Hast thou no fear in a storm, my Caligula?”
asked Tiberius.</p>

<p>“Nay, my father,” replied Caligula. The poor
prince was compelled to address the persecutor of
his family by that name.</p>

<p>“Thy Divine ancestor, Augustus, always wore
a sack of sealskin when it lightened. Jupiter,
however, never touches the laurel with his thunderbolts.
Look at the water! By the infernal
gods! no one will dare attempt to bring my
letters to-day. Go, child, to the tower and inquire
if there are any signals from the shore.”</p>

<p>Caligula departed and quickly returned.</p>

<p>“A boat rowed by four men approaches the
island, my father,” said Caligula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“At last I shall receive my letters!” exclaimed
Tiberius, with satisfaction. “Where is the little
Tiberius?”</p>

<p>“On the tower, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Let us join him and watch the landing of the
boat. Come!” ordered the emperor.</p>

<p>They climbed the steps to a high tower which
overlooked the whole eastern portion of the island.</p>

<p>Since he was brought to Capri, the youngest
son of Agrippina had lived a life of continual
dread. He had left the island but once,—the
time when he pronounced the panegyric at the
funeral of his great-grandmother, Livia. After
those few days of freedom he had returned
directly to the island. He had been informed of
the arrest of his mother and brothers, and had
heard of the death of Nero, his favorite brother;
but he dared not show his grief before the tyrant
Tiberius. Sleeping with the Prince Tiberius in
a room which adjoined the emperor’s, he could
not, even at night, show signs of grief over the
sad fate of his family.</p>

<p>The impure life at Capri was such that the
most chaste and virtuous could hardly escape
contamination. The island was filled with vile
wretches and loose women, who performed obscene
ceremonies in the rooms of the villa. The
small gardens were often the scenes of revolting
spectacles. At dinner indecent stories were told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
by pathic Greeks, while the host and his revelling
companions ate and drank like beasts. The sleeping-apartments
contained suggestive and shameful
pictures. In such an atmosphere was the youth
Caligula trained and developed. Murder was almost
a daily occurrence. The steep cliffs were
often streaked with blood. At the base of these
cliffs human bones and remnants of bodies were
sometimes washed ashore.</p>

<p>Upon the tower of the Villa Jovis the emperor
with his grandson and Caligula now stood, watching
the small boat dashed about by the tumultuous
seas. The oars moved unevenly, but the
muscles that wielded them seemed to be conquering
the violence of the waves, and the boat slowly
approached the island. Occasional clouds still
scudded across the heavens, but large patches of
blue sky showed that the storm had indeed spent
its force, as the astrologer had said.</p>

<p>“Who dares tempt the elements on such a
day?” asked Tiberius.</p>

<p>“’Tis not an imperial boat,” said Caligula.
“The men row too unevenly.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my boy,” said the emperor, contemptuously,
“the rough fishermen can out-pull the lazy
sailors who man our vessels. Why does my captain
hesitate to launch into the waters when others
dare brave them? Bah! He is a child, a babe!
Truly, he shall be punished! Verily must I wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the morrow for news from Rome? What ho!”
he yelled, calling a soldier. “Signal to yonder
peak that some one must attempt to bring me my
letters! Ye gods! We are laughed at by four
ordinary fishermen!”</p>

<p>“There is a fifth man!” said the little Tiberius.</p>

<p>“What is he doing?” asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“He appears to be bailing out the boat,” replied
the little prince Tiberius.</p>

<p>“By Neptune! They are swamping!” exclaimed
Caligula, as a huge wave struck the
boat.</p>

<p>“Ay, they have stopped rowing!” shouted the
Prince Tiberius, in a tone of fright.</p>

<p>“Now they are all bailing!” added Caligula,
excited at the brave fight the men were making.</p>

<p>“They are beginning to row again!” cried the
young Tiberius.</p>

<p>“The boat is once more on its way!” gayly
shouted Caligula.</p>

<p>“Of a truth, their bravery deserves to be rewarded,”
said Tiberius. “Who can be so anxious
to reach Capri that they should tempt
Fate by such a venture? Here, lad, carry my
laurel wreath below. The storm has passed,
and these leaves have once again saved my
life.”</p>

<p>Caligula hastened below with the wreath, and
was soon again watching the struggles of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
sailors. A signal was made from the mainland
that no one could be found to venture upon the
sea at such a time.</p>

<p>“Ye infernal deities, drag the wretches to the
realms of Pluto!” shouted Tiberius, enraged.
“The captain shall not only be beaten, but he
shall die.”</p>

<p>“Look, they are near the land!” said the Prince
Tiberius, still excitedly watching the boat with
its five brave occupants.</p>

<p>“Ah, at last they are saved!” cried Caligula,
as the boat entered the waters on the lee side of
the island.</p>

<p>The spectators of this heroic struggle descended
from the tower and walked around the garden
of the villa, looking at the destruction caused by
the terrific storm. Some time after, while they
were thus occupied, a soldier approached the
emperor and said, “A messenger from Rome
craves admittance.”</p>

<p>“Ha! The boat, then, brings tidings from
Rome! The news must be urgent!” he exclaimed.
“Has the messenger been searched?”
he asked, turning to the soldier.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord; he is the bearer of a letter,”
replied the man.</p>

<p>“Send him to me,” commanded Tiberius.</p>

<p>Drenched to the skin, the young messenger presented
himself before the emperor. He handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
him a letter, which he had succeeded in preserving
from the fury of the elements.</p>

<p>“’Tis from Antonia,” said Tiberius, as he
looked at the seal.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” ordered Tiberius, as he led the
way into the villa. “What were thy orders?”
he inquired, when they had reached the office.</p>

<p>“To rest neither day nor night until the letter
was in thy hands,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“What can she wish that orders so urgent
should be given?” he asked himself, as he broke
the seal and hastily read the first few lines. When
he reached the middle of the letter, he smiled.
“Antonia thinks she has discovered a plot against
me,” he said to himself. “She thinks that Sejanus
is aspiring to the throne! This joke is
better than any my Greeks have invented!” He
read further. When he learned that Drusus had
been killed at the instigation of Sejanus, when
he further learned that the people in Rome regarded
him, the emperor, as a prisoner, he became
serious. He turned to the messenger and said,
“Who gave thee this letter?”</p>

<p>“Macro, my lord,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“The sub-prefect gave thee thy passport?”
asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But how didst thou pass the different posts?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“The seal of Sejanus passes everywhere.”</p>

<p>“But how came the seal of Sejanus in the possession
of Macro?” asked Tiberius, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“The minister has a duplicate that Macro uses
for small commissions,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“When didst thou leave Rome?”</p>

<p>“Two days since, my lord.”</p>

<p>“But how darest thou tempt the elements while
my men shake with fear?” growled the emperor,
still irritated by the non-arrival of his letters.</p>

<p>“‘Lose not a moment!’ were the orders of
Macro. The fishermen who rowed me were
bribed by promises of large reward,” replied the
young man, modestly.</p>

<p>“What is thy name?” the emperor asked.</p>

<p>“Gyges,” replied the young hero; for it was
no other than the brave young charioteer that had
ventured out upon the turbulent sea.</p>

<p>“Thou art a Greek, the charioteer of the green
faction,” said Tiberius. “Antonia speaks of thee
in this letter. Tell me all thou knowest.”</p>

<p>“I was betrothed, my lord, to a maiden named
Psyche. She had a brother, a bright lad, named
Gannon. He was employed by Sejanus as a secretary
and a messenger. He has carried letters
even to thee, O mighty Tiberius. One day he
happened to read a communication from Livilla
to Sejanus. On the night of that day he was
murdered by order of Sejanus. But before his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
death the lad sewed to the under side of his tunic
a message. The lad’s dead body, clothed in that
tunic, was carried to his home. The tunic was
there removed. The parents of the lad were
seized and imprisoned before they could bury his
body. The father is an inoffensive schoolmaster;
the mother, a good and honest woman. At the
time of their arrest Psyche and I were walking
in the Campagna. When we reached her home,
she also was arrested. Going into the house, she
found the tunic of her dear brother. Broken-hearted,
she kissed it, when suddenly she discovered
the message. I read it with her. The poor
boy wrote that he had done wrong; that he had
‘read a letter from L to S about Lygdus.’ These
initials, my lord, referred without doubt to Livilla
and Sejanus; for Gannon had told his parents
that he had always carried messages between them.
These two names are, therefore, the only ones he
could have meant. I have known this Lygdus,
and at one time nearly became his victim. On
the road to the camp with my betrothed, I besought
her not to reveal her knowledge of the
writing. Now, O mighty emperor, hearken unto
what follows. When I left Psyche at the camp,
I went to the house of Lygdus. He was not
there. I then went to the palace of Drusus.
The gate-keeper informed me that but that very
morning the eunuch had entered the service of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
Livilla as cup-bearer. While I was speaking at
the gate, calls of the guests for their litters were
heard. I waited and watched the people hastening
in confusion from the palace. I learned that
Drusus had died suddenly. O noble lord, well
do I remember every episode of that horrible
night! After the guests had left, Sejanus arrived
and entered the palace. When he left,
Lygdus bade him farewell at the gate. An order
had been issued for my arrest; but my stable-boy
warned me and I fled to Casinum. When
Macro became sub-prefect, I hastened to him
with my story. I have ended, O mighty
Tiberius.”</p>

<p>While Gyges related his story, the emperor
nervously worked his fingers about his mouth.
Apparently these startling disclosures made but
little impression upon his callous nature. When
Gyges finished, he drawled out, “Antonia mentions
not her daughter’s name.”</p>

<p>“’Twas Livilla without doubt, my lord, who
sent the message to Sejanus about Lygdus.”</p>

<p>“Where is now the lad’s tunic?”</p>

<p>“Sejanus has destroyed it.”</p>

<p>“Where are the lad’s parents?”</p>

<p>“They are still in prison, my lord.”</p>

<p>“And the maiden Psyche?”</p>

<p>“She is a prisoner at Pandataria.”</p>

<p>“Ah, is she, then, the criminal that Sejanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
has described to me?” asked the emperor, now
truly surprised.</p>

<p>“Believe me, O mighty emperor, she is as pure
and innocent as a Vestal Virgin!” cried the young
charioteer. “Can she not be freed, my lord?”</p>

<p>“She shall suffer no harm at Pandataria,”
said Tiberius, in a tone that gave Gyges hopeful
assurance.</p>

<p>“I thank thee, my lord, I thank thee!” exclaimed
Gyges, with tremulous emotion.</p>

<p>“Now leave me,” ordered Tiberius. “On the
morrow at daybreak thou shalt carry from Capri
letters to Macro.”</p>

<p>Left alone in his office, Tiberius began to reason
with himself. “Antonia is right,” he said,
“Macro is right, and the young man Gyges, whose
honesty in the Circus is unquestioned, also seems
to speak the truth. Ah, Sejanus, thy cunning,
then, has deceived me! Full well do I now understand
thy lying statements! Ye gods! I admire
thy villany! ‘Take not the first cup!’ were
his words of warning. Ah! Drusus has been
wronged! Now do I comprehend why his hand
did not tremble when he drank of that cup! Now
do I understand why thou, Sejanus, didst wish
to marry Livilla! What subterfuge! What villany!
But the emperor can outstrip thee! He
can— By the infernal deities! can the emperor
do anything? Am I truly the emperor? Antonia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
calls me the ‘prisoner of Capri’! Of a truth,
nothing can come from Rome except through the
office of Sejanus. Ah, he has trapped me! But
has he not sacrificed many things for me? Did
he not risk his life in the grotto? True, the
danger was over when he protected me, and his
sacrifices were, after all, but so many steps towards
his own glory. Ah, he has made great
strides! But I will match my cunning against
his. My mind is not yet dead. It can still contrive
new plans. Ay, by the essences of Hades!
I will make thee consul, O Sejanus; but while
thou sippest glory from a golden chalice, I will
undermine thy power. Macro shall be the
new prefect. Money will win him and the
soldiers!”</p>

<p>He called his secretaries and wrote three letters,—one
to Macro, one to Statius the Senator,
and one to Antonia. He wrote one more,—to
Sejanus, the future consul.</p>

<p>At daybreak the next morning, with a passport
bearing the emperor’s seal, Gyges carried three
letters from Capri. The letter for Sejanus was
sent by the imperial carriers.</p>

<p>On the day of Gyges’ departure from Capri
the emperor’s nervousness increased. He became
gloomy and depressed. Every noise irritated him.
He went into the courtyard and watched the men
gather the fragments of the overthrown statue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Victory. He thought of the words of the soothsayer,
“An enemy who has long been victorious
will soon be crushed.” “He spoke truly,” said
Tiberius to himself.</p>

<p>The day after the violent storm was as clear
as crystal. The waters had again become tranquil,
and the bay of Neapolis, like a huge flower,
had unfolded with added beauty in the light of
the glorious sun. Tiberius climbed the watch-tower
and looked towards the city of Neapolis.
As he vacantly stared, the waters seemed to
change into the Campagna of Rome, which was
as red as blood. In the outline of the city he
seemed to see the fawning face of Sejanus. The
emperor turned away and looked towards Surrentum,
but even there he had left his trail of
blood. To the south he saw the open sea, but the
rocks beneath him were streaked with the blood
of those whom he had murdered. He glanced
towards the west, but there the islands of Pandataria
and Ponza, like bloody fingers, pointed
towards him. For on Pandataria Julia, his wife,
had been starved; on Ponza, Nero had lately
been strangled. Everywhere he looked he saw
blood, blood, blood!</p>

<p>That night he retired early. The lights were
extinguished, and he tried to find comfort in
sleep. But his sleep revealed to him a new world.
Indistinct figures moved before him with stealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
steps, like famished jackals. They were images
of his own crimes and of his victims. In his
vision he saw sturdy, robust men reduced to
weak and silly effeminacy by participation with
him in the vicious pleasures that consumed vitality
around him. He saw fantastic faces of violated
virgins, of filthy prostitutes with flabby
breasts floating in the foul air of his corrupt
nature. There passed before him visions of
sweet and lovely children dragged from the
heights of purity, ruined by contact with his
corruption. He twisted and groaned in torment.
He seemed to breathe an air infected with the
foul breath of low, vulgar people, the smell of
filthy sewers, the stench of carrion, the belching
of drunken men, the sweat of panting prostitutes.
He yelled as there passed before him apparitions
of tortured forms with screaming faces smeared
with blood. In all this horrible vision he heard,
like the screeching of a monstrous bird of prey,
the words of his mother, Livia, “Woe unto thee,
Tiberius; woe unto thee!” Suddenly, amid the
din of the terrible cries of woe, he saw bloody
fingers that wrote prophecies on the filthy mud
of his soul.</p>

<p>With frenzied screams he jumped from his
couch. He called for lights. He awakened the
princes. He must bury the memory of those old
crimes, of those old obscenities, of those old murders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
with new ones. “Call the Greeks!” he ordered.
“Call the dancers! Kill the cowardly
captain!” he cried in madness, as the sleepy servants
slowly lit the lamps in the luxurious rooms
of the villa.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE prisoner at Capri confers new honors
on his jailer, O Livilla,” said Sejanus,
with an evil smile, after he had received the letter
from Tiberius offering him the consulship. “He
begins to fear me.”</p>

<p>“As consul, my Sejanus, there is nothing thou
canst not do!” replied Livilla.</p>

<p>“’Twill but serve to legalize the things that
I now do covertly,” he responded.</p>

<p>“Perchance, in his increasing years, Tiberius
will make thee co-emperor?” suggested Livilla.</p>

<p>“Long since should I have seized the throne,”
said Sejanus. “I have been too lenient towards
him. But thou must marry me at once, my
love. Then usurpation will seem less harsh to
the people.”</p>

<p>“Are the soldiers still loyal to thee?” asked
Livilla.</p>

<p>“Ay, my love, loyalty is easily bought with
gold,” he replied.</p>

<p>“But if thou becomest emperor, what will become
of Tiberius?” she inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“On the day we wed, he dies,” contemptuously
responded Sejanus.</p>

<p>“Then there are Agrippina and her sons
Drusus and Caligula?” she added.</p>

<p>“They shall also die,” he said with cold-blooded
indifference. “Now, my Livilla, thou
shalt become an empress! Thy little son, Tiberius,
shall be brought from Capri, and educated
as the future ruler. Therefore hail to thee,
O mother of a line of emperors! Hail to thee!
Our lives, my love, must be united in matrimony.
Our ambitious plans have been too intricately interwoven
for us longer to live separated.”</p>

<p>“Be it as thou wishest, my love,” she acquiesced,
dazzled by the promise of so much glory.</p>

<p>“Thy beauty, my captivating divinity, fades
not with time,” he added. “Rather does it become
more radiant as the years go by. Ah,
Livilla, through the years of thy married life I
have loved thee. In thy widowhood have I loved
thee less? My love is still fresh to-day.”</p>

<p>“I too have loved thee, Sejanus,” she murmured,
as he kissed her lips. “Ah, thou rulest
my life!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my love, as empress thou shalt rule me.
But what wouldst thou have me do for thee?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“There is only one request I would make;
send Lygdus away,” she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Dost thou fear him, my love?”</p>

<p>“Ay, his face torments me,” replied the guilty
woman. “But how progresses the search for
Gyges?”</p>

<p>“One of my soldiers living at Casinum admired
four stallions that were being driven by
a boy,” said Sejanus. “Upon inquiry, it was
learned that an obscure Greek lodging in a
farm-house had trained these horses. The boy’s
name was Aldo. He worked for Gyges in the
stables of the Circus. Aldo was arrested and
questioned about his master. The little lad
even suffered torture, but his lips remained
sealed. A Greek answering the description of
Gyges travelled to Capri. Another went to
Tusculum. By to-morrow the charioteer will be
captured.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou not fear him?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I fear no one,” he replied with a defiant air.
“When we are absolute rulers, my love, none of
our enemies shall escape us. This charioteer perchance
knows nothing. He is the lover of
Gannon’s sister. Ah! but trust in me, my love.
The plans of Sejanus never fail. Have I not
rid the city of our enemies? Everything I have
done is for thee. What have I not done to
possess thee? What will I not do to retain
thee?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my love, of a truth thou hast been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
faithful lover. Be now a faithful husband. My
love for thee is also as strong as when I first
yielded my heart to thy power.”</p>

<p>“’Tis no stronger than the love I bear thee,
my Livilla. But I must return to the camp,”
he suddenly added, as he kissed her lips and
withdrew from her embrace. “Farewell, sweet
heart! Future joys be thine!”</p>

<p>“Farewell, O my lover!” she responded, looking
at him lovingly with her dreamy eyes.</p>

<p>After another lingering kiss Sejanus departed.
Escorted by his guards, he proceeded towards
the camp. As he passed a group of Senators,
two of them lowered their gaze. “’Tis an insult!”
said Sejanus to himself, hastening on his
way. When he was in his office, he sent for
Macro.</p>

<p>“Balbus and Statius have dared to insult me.
Arrest them!” sharply commanded Sejanus.
“Surely the future consul shall brave no affronts
from such men! Perchance a new plot is forming
against the emperor and me. Be vigilant, O
Macro! Let the soldiers be prepared to attack if
there be need!”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord,” said Macro, turning away.</p>

<p>“Hold!” roughly ordered Sejanus. “Thou
didst go to Tusculum two weeks since.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord,” said Macro, watching carefully
his master’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Each time thou didst return the same night.
Who was the young man thou didst meet there?”
questioned Sejanus.</p>

<p>“’Twas a friend of Antonia,” answered Macro.</p>

<p>“Ay?” added Sejanus, interrogatively. “But
thou didst also visit Antonia. Thou didst send
a letter for her to Capri by this same young man
whom thou didst see at Tusculum.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true, my lord,” said Macro, struggling
to regain his composure.</p>

<p>“The passport for the young man was made in
the name of Attius,” continued Sejanus. “But
I have already told thee that no message should be
sent to Capri except through my hands.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord; but this was but a trivial
affair,” replied Macro, relieved that Sejanus had
learned nothing further. “’Twas but a favor
for Antonia.”</p>

<p>“Hereafter even trivial things pertaining to
the emperor must be seen by me,” said the minister.
“What news of the Greek who left
Casinum?”</p>

<p>“The one who went to Capua is arrested, my
lord; the other, who went to Tusculum, has now
been tracked to Rome. On the morrow he will
be a prisoner,” said Macro.</p>

<p>“Thou art a faithful servant, O Macro. The
office of prefect may soon be thine. On the morrow
I will go to the Senate House attended by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
a guard. Thou shalt accompany me. Let the
guards thou choosest be picked men.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lord,” said Macro, as he left the
office.</p>

<p>The day wore on to midnight. In a gorgeously
furnished apartment Sejanus again proudly reclines.
A satyr-faced lamp burns on a slender
bronze pedestal. Nymphs, fauns, and nereids in
fantastic attitudes gleam from the shadowy niches
in the walls like dancing sprites. Red and yellow
oriental silks, carelessly thrown over the
chairs, look in the sallow light like tongues of
flame. An odor of incense pervades the room.
Everything suggests the lower world, and seems
like an incantation to the spirits of evil.</p>

<p>Sejanus is happy. The castles-in-the-air which
he had so laboriously designed a year ago have
now become actual realities. He looks into the
past. He sees a man who was a knight with few
friends, with few clients. That man was Sejanus.
He sees a man leading soldiers, gathering
them into one building and becoming more prominent
every day. That man was Sejanus. He
sees a man respected by the emperor, advanced
to almost equal honors, acclaimed by the Roman
Senate and people. That man was Sejanus. He
looks into the future. He sees a man sitting on
a curule chair, receiving petitions and imperiously
granting requests. That man is Sejanus. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
finally sees, ruling the world, one man who has
reached the highest possible place for mortal man.
That man is the Emperor Sejanus!</p>

<p>On the path of his advancement he has left the
corpses of some trivial common people, the dead
bodies of the heir Drusus and the Prince Nero.
With the eye of his mind he sees along his triumphal
road the faces of Tiberius, Agrippina,
Drusus, and Caligula—pale and rigid in death.
No one now stands between him and the throne.
The culmination of his triumph is reached. His
foot is raised to take the final step. He takes
from a table a golden cup, and with infinite satisfaction
quaffs a toast to the genius who presides
over his destiny.</p>

<p>The next morning, surrounded by a host of
suitors and clients, he proceeds to the Senate
House. On his way he is slighted by many of the
Senators. He hears suppressed cries of “Murderer,”
“Usurper.” Noticing that among the
people a decided change has taken place, the
suitors and clients, one by one, gradually excuse
themselves. When the great minister arrives at
the door of the Senate House, he is attended by
only his guards and Macro. The soldiers are
stationed at the door; Macro and Sejanus enter.
The Conscript Fathers, in their soft and majestic
woolen togas bordered with purple, have already
entered upon the day’s routine. They rise and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
bow, as Sejanus takes his seat amongst them.
Macro stations himself near the raised platform
on which the consul is seated.</p>

<p>Statius does not take his seat after he has
greeted Sejanus. He walks slowly to the tribunal,
and petitions the consul for time to read a communication
from the emperor. Then, with careful
intonation and impressive gestures, he reads
the charge of treason against Sejanus. Overwhelmed
by this stupendous charge, Sejanus interrupts
the speaker. The consul rises quickly
from his curule chair and commands silence. As
Statius continues reading the letter, all the Senators
near Sejanus withdraw to the other side of
the house. Left all alone, Sejanus shouts in rage,
“’Tis a forgery!”</p>

<p>“There is the emperor’s seal!” cries Statius,
in a loud tone, pointing to the scroll stamped with
the emperor’s seal.</p>

<p>At this point Macro, accompanied by two
soldiers, approaches Sejanus. The face of the
sub-prefect is pale and determined. Drawing his
sword and grasping the shoulder of the stupefied
minister, he shouts, “I arrest thee in the name of
the emperor!”</p>

<p>“I demand a trial!” yells Sejanus.</p>

<p>“’Tis too late,” replies Macro. “Here is thy
sentence of death.”</p>

<p>Sejanus struggles as the soldiers drag him from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
the Senate Chamber. Outside, cries, groans, and
curses are heaped upon him by the same people
who but yesterday hailed him with acclamations.</p>

<p>“’Twas Gyges whom I met at Tusculum, O
Sejanus,” hisses Macro, tauntingly, as they walked
along. “’Twas Gyges who carried the evidence
of the murder of Drusus. ’Twas Gyges who
brought the order for thy death; for die thou
shalt at once!” exclaims Macro to the terrified
minister, as they proceed towards the prison.</p>

<p>With his face livid with fear, Sejanus beseeches
his soldiers for help and pity. But their ears are
deaf. He is hurried to the Mamertine Prison near
by. For a few moments only, he is left to think
of his past life; then he is strangled; and his
body, still warm, is thrown out upon the Gemmonian
Steps. The suppressed hatred of the people
now breaks out in all its fury. In the mob that
waits outside of the prison are Senators and tribunes.
The dead body is soon stripped of its
robes, and after being battered about the streets
of the city for a day, it is cast into the rushing
muddy Tiber.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the island of Pandataria Agrippina and
Psyche still lingered in imprisonment. The
mother, crushed under her latest affliction, lived
a life of savage grief. Her soul trembled with
infinite sadness, like the last falling leaf on a
solitary tree. Whether in violent storms, in
the dashing of the waves against the rocks, in
the cries of the sea-gulls, in the fishermen’s songs,
or in the Homeric songs of Psyche, she heard
but one word, intensified or softened, “Woe!”
Each morning was to her a new birth of anguish.
But Psyche began to brighten under the sunny
skies and the comparative freedom in which she
lived. The uncertainty regarding the fate of her
family and of her lover still oppressed her soul,
but she had regained her natural color and had
become more beautiful than ever. Grief had
changed the face of youthful beauty to one of
patient and womanly loveliness.</p>

<p>Both women suffered under overwhelming afflictions;
but the grief of Agrippina was vehement,
savage, and tragic, while that of Psyche was
calm, quiet, and self-controlled. Agrippina had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
sustained calamitous sorrows. Her sufferings
comprehended inexpressible torments, misfortunes
without a name, blind struggles, exhausted tears.
Psyche had endured more gentle suffering. Her
afflictions were lightened by the hope that exists
in youth, by the purer faith of a young heart, by
the charity that still saw good in others, and, above
all, by the belief in answered prayers. Agrippina
was the sad flower of grief; Psyche was the
perfume.</p>

<p>One evening when they had gone to their rooms,
and Agrippina had thrown herself upon her couch,
Psyche leaned against the window and looked out
upon the night.</p>

<p>“Canst thou breathe the salt air from where
thou sittest, my lady?” asked Psyche.</p>

<p>“Ay, my child; ’tis refreshing.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou hear a solitary voice singing in
the darkness?”</p>

<p>“Ay; ’tis a plaintive song.”</p>

<p>“It seems like a musical breath rising from
the sea,” said Psyche, softly.</p>

<p>“It rests the mind,” Agrippina replied abstractedly.</p>

<p>“How bright are the stars!” exclaimed Psyche.
“Their reflection on the trembling waters
looks like happy smiles. What is happiness, my
lady?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear child, happiness is made of things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
intangible and fleeting. ’Tis as light as the
feathery thistle-down.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my sweet lady, only in my dreams do
I now enjoy happiness.”</p>

<p>“Even in my dreams, gentle child, am I denied
solace,” replied Agrippina. “Ah! from the profundities
of grief I have drunk great draughts.
The sleep of that intoxication is filled with bitter
dreams.”</p>

<p>“Like a stream that flows and flows, with incessant
murmuring, restless struggling, and furious
scoring, has been thy grief, my lady,” said
Psyche, as she left the window and sat down near
Agrippina. “In my impersonations I too have
palpitated in the waters of grief. With mine
eyes floating in tears have I suffered the sorrows
of Niobe.”</p>

<p>“When I saw thee impersonate Niobe, my
sweet child, mine eyes too were veiled with tears.
When, one by one, Niobe loses her children, and
sorrow is added to sorrow, grief to grief, the
gradual increase of anguish thou didst well portray.
But, my dear child, like the perfectly carved
statue, beautiful but not living, thou didst lack
the power to portray a mother’s grief. Then I
saw it not; but to-day verily do I believe that no
one could perfectly act the part unless she had
suffered as I have.”</p>

<p>“In the mirror of the centuries I have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
seen a reflection of grief truer than thine, my
lady.”</p>

<p>“Give me thine hand, dear Psyche,” exclaimed
Agrippina. “How warm it feels!”</p>

<p>“Thy hand is cold, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Ay; so is my heart.”</p>

<p>“Fearest thou further woes, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my Psyche. Two sons are still left me.
Both are in prison. How long will they be
spared?”</p>

<p>“They will not die like Nero,” said Psyche,
reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Ah! when my first brother was murdered,
I thought the other two would be spared, but they
too fell under the malice of their enemies. My
sister has been banished, my mother starved to
death, my husband poisoned, my friends cruelly
murdered; Nero, my beloved son Nero, has been
strangled. Now Drusus is in the dungeon on the
Palatine; Caligula is at Capri. Why, oh, why
may I not die before I hear of their tragic end?
Ah, my dear child, I am like a branch burdened
with maturing fruits of grief, broken but living.”</p>

<p>“Words cannot comfort thee, my dear lady;
let me sing thee a hymn. ’Tis the one my mother
was wont to sing when she wished to close my
childish eyes in sleep. ’Tis the hymn that has
been sung for generations in my fatherland.”</p>

<p>“Sit thou on my couch, dear child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>Resting beside her mistress and with the tips
of her fingers gently stroking the extended arm
of Agrippina, Psyche sang a sweet melody. It
was a song that had been nourished on the sacred
mountain heights of Greece and had been watered
from the immortal fountains of maternal love.
Borne on the soft rhythm of the tune, the words
appeared like flashes of calm light on a river of
melody.</p>

<p>“’Tis a peaceful song, my child,” said Agrippina,
as Psyche’s voice died away in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lady, my father taught us that the
music and poetry of Greece always touch the soul.
He also taught us that life is a continuous song.
There are melodies of solitude, of submission, of
purification, of passion, of desolation, and of despairing
grief. Some of the music is discordant
to the ear of youth. ’Tis not until we are aged
that we understand the true melody.”</p>

<p>“Ay, in Rome ’tis said that youth sees not
that which he has to gain. The old man dreams
of that which he has lost,” said Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Would that we had a copy of Plato, dear
lady,” said Psyche, dreamily. “Then could I
read to thee soothing truths for thy soul. But
I weary thee,” she said, as she arose. “May
sleep breathe on thine eyes sweet forgetfulness!”</p>

<p>“The gods watch over thee, my child!” responded
Agrippina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>On a perfect day, not long after, the two prisoners
were seated upon the rocks, looking dreamily
at the sea.</p>

<p>“Where are thy thoughts, my child?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” said Psyche, “how happy
must be the spirit of the sea!”</p>

<p>“Happier than that of the mountains?” asked
Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady; the mountains cast shadows,”
replied Psyche.</p>

<p>“But the waters, dear child, cover unfathomable
abysses.”</p>

<p>“True, O lady. Never until now have I lived
by the sea. In my prison cell alone, with no
sound save that of the breaking of the waves of
silence on the shores of meditation, I have sometimes
gathered sparkling objects, sprays of broken
thoughts and iridescent dreams. At other times
I have seen living and crawling objects that frightened
me.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou have no companionship in the
camp, my poor child?”</p>

<p>“I was always alone, my lady. My jailer was
a mute, and for months I heard no words.”</p>

<p>“Then how didst thou pass the weary hours?”</p>

<p>“I would sometimes sing a hymn to the immortal
mother of us all. The melody of hymns
in the sea of silence, gentle lady, flashes away
like bright sparkles from a gem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“The gods are sometimes deaf to hymns and
prayers, my child.”</p>

<p>“Ah, beautiful prayers are never lost, my lady.
Yonder where the sun sets are immeasurable seas.
Are they not bordered by a land of promise? Ah,
O lady, the whole world is an ear. Our petitions
may seem to fall like stones into dark waters,
but, believe me, they do reach the divinities.
Let us pray to Juno this night that sweet
Peace, like a new-born child, may come to our
minds.”</p>

<p>“Speak on, my child. Thy words are gentle.
They soothe my soul.”</p>

<p>“From the window of my cell,” continued
Psyche, “so intently have I gazed upon the
peaceful Campagna that mine eyes have become
intoxicated. The Campagna seemed the bottom
of a sea, the purple mountains a shore; ’twas an
oblivion of peace.”</p>

<p>Agrippina closed her eyes while Psyche was
speaking. From time to time she would move
her lips and form silent words.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady,” continued Psyche, “but I
would awaken from that revery. My life, my
grief, would again burden me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear Psyche, life is, after all, but a dream
between two slumbers. Mine has been a fantasy
of terror.”</p>

<p>“Look, yonder at the provision boat, floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
along the water like a sea-gull!” suddenly exclaimed
Psyche.</p>

<p>“See how it leans; the sails are well filled,”
replied Agrippina.</p>

<p>“’Tis a land breeze. Perchance it breathes
news from Rome,” said Psyche, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Thou art always hopeful, my child!”</p>

<p>“See how it dips! See how it rises! ’Tis a
cheering sight,” cried Psyche, her eyes sparkling
and her lips parting in a pleasing smile.</p>

<p>“Sad news is sometimes borne by smiling
faces,” said Agrippina, trying to restrain the
happy flow of Psyche’s spirits.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lady, not on this day! How fresh
is the air! How bright are the skies! The birds
fly faster! See the boat dance upon the waters!
Ah, I seem to breathe an aroma that affects me
like a happy song.”</p>

<p>“From the clear skies anguish sometimes
falls,” again Agrippina sadly but kindly warned
the gentle maiden.</p>

<p>Intently they watched the boat as it gradually
drew near the island. When the anchor had been
cast and a small boat had brought some passengers
to the land, a cheer rang out from the
soldiers who had gathered at the landing.
Shortly after, the officer who guarded the prisoners
approached them and handed a letter to
Psyche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“A letter for me!” said the dancing-girl, with
her eyes opened wide with surprise.</p>

<p>“Perchance, good news!” said the officer, as
he went away.</p>

<p>“Look, my lady!” said Psyche, excitedly.
“’Tis Macro’s seal!”</p>

<p>“Let me see, my child,” said Agrippina.
“Ah! Macro is prefect! Can it be that Sejanus
is emperor? Hasten thou, my child; read
the contents!”</p>

<p>Quickly breaking the seal, Psyche read the first
few words. “’Tis from Gyges!” she screamed
with joy. “He is safe! My parents are free!
Oh! my lady, said I not that the boat bore good
tidings?”</p>

<p>“Read on, O Psyche!”</p>

<p>“Sejanus is dead! Oh! my lady, our enemy
has at last received his punishment. Papers for
my release have gone to the emperor for his signature!
O ye celestial gods, I thank thee! I
thank thee!”</p>

<p>“Says Gyges nothing more, my child?” asked
Agrippina, moved to unwonted cheerfulness by
the excessive joy of Psyche.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady! I am so happy I know not
what to do!”</p>

<p>She continued reading. Her face was radiant,
and her black eyes danced as she looked at the
letter. Suddenly she uttered a scream. Her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
grew white, her eyes frightened. A terrible revulsion
of feeling had seized her.</p>

<p>Agrippina quickly asked, “What has happened,
my child?”</p>

<p>“O my sweet lady, I love thee. I have tried
to lighten thy burden of grief. Yet I had to be
the bearer of the news of Nero’s death. Tell me
that thou lovest me.”</p>

<p>“Dear child, I know not what thou meanest.
We have lived together many days. We have
been more than friends. Why dost thou speak
so wildly?”</p>

<p>“I am now calm,” said Psyche, breathing a
deep sigh. “The path of joy along which I so
quickly ran ended on the edge of an abyss.”</p>

<p>“Thy parents are not crazed by confinement?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lady,” said Psyche, and then relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>“Ah, my child, I begin to understand thee.
The abyss is news of fresh anguish for me. Said
I not that from the clearest skies anguish sometimes
falls? What—what has now happened to
my family?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my lady, forgive me! Drusus
is no more!”</p>

<p>“They have killed him!” cried Agrippina,
bewildered.</p>

<p>“He was starved to death, my lady. Oh, let
me shed tears for thee, for thine eyes are dry,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
said Psyche, as she threw her arms around the
neck of her companion and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>For some time Agrippina uttered no word.
Her face had become rigid, her eyes wild.
Finally she rose and said: “Come, Psyche, I
have been taught how to die. Come, come,
come!” The last word was whispered with an
indescribable moan.</p>

<p>“Whither goest thou?”</p>

<p>“I too will die.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my sweet lady! nay! Speak not such
words!”</p>

<p>“Ay, dear child; my mother was starved,
Drusus was starved—I too will starve.”</p>

<p>Supported by Psyche, she went into the building,
into her room. She then prepared for bed,
as if it were night. She laid herself upon her
couch with eyes closed. She said nothing, but
groaned incessantly.</p>

<p>A day passed by—two days—without her
eating or drinking anything. She resolutely refused
food and drink, notwithstanding the pleadings
of her companion.</p>

<p>On the third day the officer presented himself
before Agrippina and commanded her to eat and
drink.</p>

<p>“That will I not do,” said Agrippina.</p>

<p>“I am ordered to make thee eat,” said the
officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“From whom comes that order?”</p>

<p>“From the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Tell him that I refuse.”</p>

<p>The officer withdrew. He sent a letter to Capri,
asking for further instructions. The answer was
borne by a new officer, the previous one having
been arrested for disobedience.</p>

<p>The new officer was a man with a brutal face.
He spoke with a growl. He entered Agrippina’s
room, accompanied by two soldiers equally brutal
in appearance. He said to Agrippina: “The old
officer has lost his position for disobedience. That
wrong is punishable by death at Capri. I have
been ordered to make thee eat.”</p>

<p>“Does the emperor think that he can force
me?” asked Agrippina.</p>

<p>“Ay; and I have brought thee some bread and
water.”</p>

<p>Agrippina made no reply.</p>

<p>“I insist that thou shalt eat.”</p>

<p>“I refuse.”</p>

<p>“Again I insist,” said the officer, becoming
angry.</p>

<p>“Again I refuse.”</p>

<p>“In the name of the emperor, I command thee
to eat.”</p>

<p>Agrippina made no reply.</p>

<p>“Bind her and force open her mouth!” shouted
the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Psyche tried to interfere, and called for help.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers held Agrippina’s head;
the other, with his sword, tried to pry open her
mouth. The officer stood leaning over her, with
some bread soaked in water. So roughly did the
soldier use his sword that it slipped, and, tearing
Agrippina’s lip and cheek, gouged out her eye.
At this sickening sight Psyche swooned. Finally
the brutes succeeded in opening her mouth, and
the officer forced some bread down her throat.
This frightful ordeal ended, the women were
then left alone.</p>

<p>When Psyche returned to consciousness, her
mind seemed paralyzed with horror, but her
tender heart prompted her to relieve the suffering
of the tortured woman. She tied a bandage
over the wounded eye of Agrippina, and procuring
a basin of water, bathed the torn lip and cheek
of her mistress.</p>

<p>“Dost thou suffer much pain?” softly whispered
Psyche.</p>

<p>“My body pains, my dear child. My mind
is dead,” she answered in a hollow voice that
sounded like a whisper from a tomb.</p>

<p>“What is there that I can do for thee, my
lady?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, my child. They may try to force
me again, but I am resolved to die. Speak to
me no more, I pray thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Through the remaining hours of that day and
all that night Psyche never left her mistress. The
next morning the dancing-girl was cruelly forced
to leave Pandataria and go to Rome.</p>

<p>Two days later, the long tragedy was ended.
The heroic sufferer had gained her point and had
starved herself to death. Her tragic sorrows were
over and her triumph had come. She had conquered
the emperor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the peristyle of a small house not far
from the Porta Capena, a little woman sings
a happy song as she tends and gathers her
flowers. A fountain adds its liquid sound to her
pleasing melody. It is near sundown, and the
peristyle is bathed in soft light reflected from a
clear blue sky. In a corner of the corridor that
surrounds the peristyle, a bright-faced lad lies
upon a couch. A hunchbacked girl with long
arms and slanting but kind face hands him a cup
of water and moves silently away. The little
woman takes a tuft of mignonette and gives it
to the happy-faced lad, saying, “That will refresh
thee after thy tired and anxious day.”</p>

<p>“Thou art too kind, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Do thy limbs pain thee less, Aldo?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lady,” replies the lad, anxious to appear
better and stronger than he really is.</p>

<p>“Cruelly did they torture thee, my Aldo.”</p>

<p>“Ay; they were brutal. But they learned not
from me my master’s hiding-place.”</p>

<p>“Brave and heroic lad, thy silence saved us
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“How I long for the stables at the Circus!”
cries Aldo. “The horses my master trained at
Casinum are the finest beasts that ever appeared
at Rome. He will win the race this day!”</p>

<p>“Thinkest thou so? ’Tis the first race he has
run since he fled from the city with thee.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my lady, he was not idle at Casinum.
No one can equal my master. The horses may
become frightened, but he will be able to hold
them.”</p>

<p>“Would that I were less nervous! I cannot
look at the Circus without becoming faint. The
race must soon be over.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lady; we have not heard the sound
of victory.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Aldo, I fear thy master has lost.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear, my lady; the cheers will
come.”</p>

<p>The little woman begins to walk nervously
around the corridor. Will he win? Will he
lose? These are the questions that torment her
mind. He had left her at noonday, filled with
cheering hopes. He had kissed her and had said:
“Ah, little heart, this night we ought to be far
richer. I have the winning horses, and everything
is propitious. A fair portion of the prize
I will bestow upon Hermes if he but guides mine
arms!” As the moments pass by, the little woman
tears a flower which she holds in her hand. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
stops again by Aldo and says, “He has lost!”
Suddenly a faint sound is heard, gradually increasing,
until a violent cheer rends the air. “He
has won! he has won!” screams the little woman.
“Nana! he has won!”</p>

<p>The good, faithful old Nana comes into the
corridor and adds her enthusiasm to that of her
mistress.</p>

<p>“By Hermes! said I not so, my lady?” cries
Aldo, with tears of joy running down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, my boy!” replies the little woman,
hysterically.</p>

<p>“Never do the other factions make such a
noise when they win. ’Tis the Green! Oh that
I could have helped my master to harness the
horses!”</p>

<p>“The days have been happy since thou didst
enter the house, my mistress,” exclaims Nana,
appearing in the corridor. “Each day brings
added joy.”</p>

<p>The little humpback shyly looks from the door
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Come, Lupa! Share our happiness. Thy
master is again the hero of the Green faction.”</p>

<p>Some time after, a second cheering is heard.
This time it appears nearer. The little woman
hastens to the door and looks towards the Via
Appia. She sees the victor, crowned with olive
and with a palm branch in his hand, coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
towards her, escorted by an admiring throng.
So filled is she with an indescribable feeling of
joy that she rushes towards him, crying, “Gyges,
O my Gyges!”</p>

<p>The charioteer, not less excited than the little
woman, hastens his steps, and seizing her in his
arms and kissing her, exclaims: “O Psyche, my
little wife, what intense happiness is ours!”</p>

<p>A new cry of enthusiasm rises from the crowd.
At the door of his home Gyges turns to them
and says: “Friends, ye are no happier than I
am! ’Twas a hard-earned victory. May the
Greens always trust me! These muscles are always
at their service! At the inn of Furnius
I have ordered four thousand cups of wine to
be given away. Fare ye well! May Hermes
always be gracious towards us, as he has been
this day!”</p>

<p>After another prolonged cheer the crowd departs.</p>

<p>In the peristyle, with his arms extended as far
as he is able towards his master, Aldo leans from
his couch. Gyges takes the extended hands in
his. The lad covers those of his master with
kisses. “I am so happy! so happy! so happy,
my master!” he cries, with large tears gushing
from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ay, my little hero, the horses we trained at
Casinum carried me to victory. ’Twas in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
manner, O wife.—Ah, Nana, thine eyes are
bright and the poor Lupa is also happy!—My
horses were fresh but restless. Finally the signal
was given, the doors of the <i>carceres</i> were thrown
open, and the race began. The pace was unusually
fast, but at the fourth turn my horses were
nearly as fresh as when they started. The smallest
one of the four could not run in the same
rhythm with the others.”</p>

<p>“The same old fault, my master,” said Aldo,
with his eyes opened wide with excitement.</p>

<p>“Ay, so busy was I trying to get him under
control that at the fifth turn the Red and the
White succeeded in pocketing me. Instantly I
saw my danger, and quickly reining the horses,
who were now moving as one, I made a sudden
turn to the right. Nothing, my Psyche, nothing,
my Aldo, would have won the race for me if there
had been the least fault in that quick turn.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, my master,” said Aldo, nervously
patting the cover of his couch.</p>

<p>“But the very thing we trained them for at
Casinum, O Aldo, was the trick that saved the
day. Never before have I seen horses turn so
quickly. In all my experience never have I seen
such beautiful movement. The White was taken
back with surprise. He tried to cut me out; but
one word, one toss of the reins, one long cheer
to the horses that know my every whisper, succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
in bringing me clear of the rest. Oh the
speed with which we made the sixth turn! The
Red had the inside track and we were even. With
the cracking of the whips, the hoof-beats of the
horses, and the cheering of the sanguine Greens
all ringing in mine ears, I made my supreme effort.
I called each horse by name. I steadied them
with the last bit of strength in my body. As we
reached the final stretch, I was slightly in the lead.
Oh, the cries of the people were deafening! Every
one of the charioteers was exerting himself to
the utmost. By some invisible power I succeeded
in instilling into my horses my own enthusiasm.
O my lad, on, on, on, we went towards the final
goal! The enthusiasm of the vast crowd now
passed all bounds, my Psyche. ‘He has it! he
has it!’ were the words that rent the air when,
a full chariot’s length ahead of them all, I passed
the stand of the judges!”</p>

<p>“Said I not my master would win, my lady?”
asks Aldo, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“Ay, my lad,” replies Psyche.</p>

<p>“How feelest thou?” asks Gyges, turning
kindly to Aldo.</p>

<p>“A few days more and I shall be able to help
thee, my master.”</p>

<p>“The physician has been here, my husband.
He says that Aldo will be able to walk with
crutches two weeks hence. He has so bandaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
the lad’s limbs that the boy can scarcely
move.”</p>

<p>“Not two weeks hence, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Aldo.”</p>

<p>“Spartans must have been thine ancestors,
Aldo. Thou wert a true hero to have kept silence
under torture. ’Twas that silence, brave lad, that
gives us our present happiness. I will not only
make thee free, but I share with thee my winnings
of this day!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my master; I wish for nothing. I am
content if I may live with thee.”</p>

<p>“Come, dear heart,” says Gyges, taking
Psyche’s hand, “let us sit together in our favorite
place in the peristyle and watch the play of
the fountain as the evening dies away.”</p>

<p>Seated on the same stone bench where they
passed their happy afternoon before Psyche’s
arrest, the loving couple lose themselves in meditation.
The fountain plays its old joyful air.</p>

<p>“The months we were separated, O sweet wife,
were bitter ones; but now in happy matrimonial
bonds we live a new life of peace.”</p>

<p>“True, O Gyges; it seems as if my mind had
been meanwhile in dense obscurity. Often does
my memory revert to the sufferer with whom I
passed the last months of my imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“Ay, tyranny did not end with the death of
Sejanus,” replies Gyges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Ah, she was a living Niobe. Never shall I
forget her expression when I told her that Drusus
had been starved to death—O poor, poor Agrippina!”
she exclaims, her eyes filling with tears.
“But we are now happy,” she adds after a pause.
“My life in our new home is a continuous song
of joy.”</p>

<p>“Thou art the same happy Psyche.”</p>

<p>“Thou art the same brave Gyges.”</p>

<p>“Braver than my sweet wife, who has struggled
so heroically?”</p>

<p>“Without the sustaining hope of thy love, my
husband, the dancing-girl would have succumbed
under her afflictions. The golden necklace was
a great solace. Each stone sparkled with recollections
of thee, joined together with golden links
of love.”</p>

<p>“Thou, sweet wife, wert all in all to me. At
Casinum ’twas Psyche who ruled my thoughts.
’Twas Psyche whose name was carried on my
prayers. ’Twas thy love that sustained me in
my hiding-place. This day, while making the
last turn, ’twas the thought of thee that gave
me the necessary stimulation to carry me on to
glorious victory. Coming from the Circus, I felt
as one of the victorious youths must have felt
when he left the Olympian Games. The cheers
of the people fell upon mine ears like prophetic
songs of future victories. When I saw thee at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
the door of our house, my heart throbbed with
supreme joy. O my love, we have reached the
summit of our happiness!”</p>

<p>At this point their happy reveries are checked
by a knock at the door. Lupa quickly answers
the call. Alcmaeon and Hera enter. At the
sound of her parents’ voices Psyche rushes to
meet them.</p>

<p>“We have heard the happy news, O
Psyche. Hail to thee, victorious son!” exclaims
Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“’Twas a glorious day, my father! Come,
sit thou in the peristyle! The evening meal is
not yet ready. Thou, O mother, may sit with
Psyche. We can be two lovers and rest at their
feet, my father! Come!”</p>

<p>“We are proud of thee, my son!” says Hera.
“Again the Greek has conquered. How is the
lad Aldo?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my mother, he frets under the restraint
of his bandages.”</p>

<p>“He is sleeping, O Psyche,” whispers Lupa,
timidly.</p>

<p>“The prize this day, my father, was a large
one,” says Gyges to Alcmaeon, as they gather
around the stone bench in the peristyle. “When
the racing-season is over, we will all go to
Corinth.”</p>

<p>“A schoolmaster cannot leave his duties.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>“Ay; Macro will find another position for
thee when thou returnest.”</p>

<p>“Ah! shall we all really see the city of our ancestors?”
asked Alcmaeon. “Shall we again see
Corinth, the eye of Greece, old, ’tis true, but still
undimmed in lustre? Breathing the divine air
from the sublime heights of Corinth, shall we see
the living words of the Iliad? Shall we see the
country that stirred the sainted soul of Homer?”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to lose the sight of cruel
Rome,” says Hera.</p>

<p>“Ah, my wife,” exclaims the happy father,
with his old enthusiasm for his wonderful country,
“the Greek has conquered the Roman this
day. The Greek has thrown Sejanus from his
lofty seat. Did I not say, my children, that
physical strength is overmatched by intellectual
power? Have we accomplished our ends with
blaring trumpets? In the silence of Aldo there
was more power than in all the vaunted greatness
of the infamous Sejanus. If the lad had
uttered but a word at that crucial moment, the
history of Rome would have been changed.”</p>

<p>“Thou speakest truly, O father,” says Gyges.</p>

<p>“The Greeks are thought to be weak, O my
son, but they were once the greatest nation that
ever lived. Ay, in the shadows of divine mountains,
in the soft light of sacred valleys, has the
truth entered into the souls of our countrymen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
While our ancestors were clanging their swords
against the sacred ones suspended over the doors
of our columned temples, in order to make themselves
invincible in battle; while the seeds of our
heroes were ripening on Iliadic plains; while the
words of Aeschylus—the heroic Son of a Divinity—were
being sung in white theatres to the Hellenes,
frenzied with religious dithyrambics,—what
were the Romans doing? They were worshipping
terra-cotta figures; they were living in huts; they
knew neither poetry nor philosophy.”</p>

<p>“Thou fillest our souls with love for our
Fatherland, O my sire,” exclaims Psyche, moved
by the words of Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>“Fatherland!” continues Alcmaeon. “Ay, in
the minds of the Greeks have originated the truths
of the world. The divine spirit of our Fatherland
shone in a glorious, effulgent day. Having
long warmed the world with celestial rays, the
spirit now sleeps. There will be a morrow, my
loved ones, when the harvest grown under that
heat will be garnered. Ah, shall we ever see the
day when triumphant Athene shall take the spear
and shield from restless and impetuous Ares and
crown his head with the olive-wreath of peace?”</p>

<p>Alcmaeon pauses. His voice is trembling. He
seems to be gathering fresh thoughts from the
profoundest depths of his mind. The evening
has now fallen, and the peristyle is shrouded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
darkness. So impressive is the effect of Alcmaeon’s
words that his pensive hearers are
stirred to the very radicles of their souls.</p>

<p>“Fatherland! Fatherland!” he continues, “we
shall see the quiet fields of Greece in the pacific
radiance of her glorious religion. We shall see
our noble temples. We shall encircle with our
arms the pure columns,—beautiful sisters of
holy hymns. We shall feel in our veins the pulsations
of that inspiration which moved the God
of Poetry to sing the immortal Iliad. In our
Fatherland, where tremble every mountain, every
river, every fountain, every grove, every laurel
and myrtle, all trembling like a single leaf, all
twinkling like a single star, with the fervor of
infinite Goodness, infinite Beauty, and infinite
Truth,—there, my beloved ones, we shall breathe
in the aroma of future incense! We shall feel
the Titanic throb of our past greatness! We shall
see with prophetic eyes the final triumph of Greek
thought over the world!”</p>

<p>From out the darkness, while Alcmaeon spoke
these last words, the enraptured listeners hear a
clear soprano voice singing a cradle-song. It
seems like a voice from another world. It is
Aldo, who, moved by his happy dreams, half
awake, sings the song that is dearest to him.
Alcmaeon starts, and when the song dies away, he
asks Gyges, “Where did Aldo learn that song?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>“I know not, O father.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a song that is sung only by those who
come from Corinth.”</p>

<p>Alcmaeon rises and goes towards Aldo’s couch.
He gently touches him and asks, “Where didst
thou learn that song?”</p>

<p>The lad awakes and drowsily asks, “What—what
song?”</p>

<p>“Wert thou asleep?”</p>

<p>“Ay. Did I sing in my sleep?”</p>

<p>“Ay, thou didst,” replies Alcmaeon; “and
’twas a song that only we who come from
Corinth sing.”</p>

<p>“I know only one song,” says Aldo, “and if
I sang, ’twas the one my parents taught me.”</p>

<p>“Who were thy parents, my lad?”</p>

<p>“They were Greeks, slaves.”</p>

<p>“What was thy father’s name, Aldo?”</p>

<p>“Gannon.”</p>

<p>“Of a truth?” exclaims Alcmaeon, greatly
surprised.</p>

<p>“Ay; my name was Alcmaeon, but my Roman
master called me Aldo.”</p>

<p>“Verily do I believe that thou art one of the
family of Alcmaeons. Where is thy bulla?”</p>

<p>Nana interrupts the conversation with the announcement
that the evening meal is served.</p>

<p>“Bring me a light, my Nana. Come hither,
all!” commands Alcmaeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>When a light is handed him, he reads on the
little copper bulla that hangs on a string around
Aldo’s neck the words, in Greek, “a child of the
Alcmaeons.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my lad, thou art a true descendant of
the Alcmaeons!” cries the happy schoolmaster.
“Here, here is the kiss of relationship. Behold,
Hera, Psyche, and Gyges, we have found a hero
in our family.”</p>

<p>“Am I truly thy kinsman?” asks the wondering
lad.</p>

<p>“Ah, Aldo, thou art no longer a slave,” cries
Gyges. “Thou art free!”</p>

<p>“And I will adopt thee as my son,” exclaims
Alcmaeon, with tender emotion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A year rolls by. Meantime the promised visit
to Corinth has been made and the family have
now returned to Rome. In the house of Gyges
there is great excitement. Hera and Psyche are
in the cubiculum. Gyges, accompanied by Psyche’s
father and her foster-brother Aldo, called
now Alcmaeon, proudly leaves the house and
walks towards the Temple of Juno on the Aventine
Hill. He goes to register the birth of a
son.</p>

<p>When a man is summoned home to attend the marriage to
another man of the woman he loves, and when the bridegroom
is his own brother, the situation is certainly very striking.
The wedding does not take place, for the bridegroom is
murdered. The scene in which the victim appears to his

All this is disclosed in the opening chapter, and paves the way

<p>Mr. Nason’s new novel deals with the beginnings of
orange growing in California by irrigation. Elijah Berl, a New
Englander, emigrates to California, and dreams of the time
when the barren region in which he has settled shall “blossom
as the rose.” Engineering ambitions, the formation of a company
for the development of the orange industry, the building
of an irrigation dam, and the collapse of a land boom, furnish
the author material for a well-constructed plot.</p>

<p>In this gallant romance of love and daring, in which the
action is swift, the characters are individual and interesting, and
the atmosphere and setting are well adapted to the theme. The
scene is laid at Althorpe, the stately home of the Spencers.
Lady Elizabeth Spencer, daughter of Lord Sunderland, and
through his sordid and ambitious motives married at the age of
eleven to Lord Clancarty, makes the most charming of heroines,
and her nobility of character and faithful love are finely and
tenderly portrayed.</p>

<p>Another strong Western story with spirited and graphic
picturing of local conditions, the agricultural development of
a Western ranch section, and the struggle between the ranchmen
and the farmers. The story has three remarkably striking
scenes of danger—a high-grass fire, a stampede of excited
cattle, and a terrific storm and cloud-burst. There is abundant
love interest; also a strong political element, dealing
with Colorado politics and the fight between cattlemen and
irrigationists to control the legislature, in which the hero becomes
the storm centre. The attempt of a beautiful, crafty, and unscrupulous
woman, who is a wrecker of hearts and of men, to
influence his vote for United States senator plays an important part.</p>

<p>A remarkable story of cattle ranges of Arizona, the great
desert, and the grand cañon of the Colorado river. The author
has written a romance of adventure, of conflict, and of love,—a
story of breathless interest, remarkable situation, and great
humor and pathos. Chalkeye, the cowboy who tells the story,
Captain McCalmont, the robber-chief, Lord Babshannon, the
owner of a Colorado ranch, his son “Jim,” and “Curly,” who

<p>This strong, historical novel deals with the period when
Tiberius went to live in the island of Capri and built his
palace, and with the attempt of Sejanus, Commander of the
Prætorian Guards, to make himself Emperor of Rome. The
characters of the corrupt Emperor Tiberius, Sejanus, his favorite,
and Agrippina, the widow of Germanicus, are portrayed
with great power, and the author has described the Rome of
the time with the utmost faithfulness. Psyche, the heroine, is
a beautiful Greek dancer, betrothed to Gyges, a charioteer in
the Roman circus.</p>
